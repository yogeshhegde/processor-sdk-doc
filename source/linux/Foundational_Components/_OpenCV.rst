Introduction
==============

`OpenCV <http://opencv.org/>`__ (Open Source Computer Vision Library)
is an open-source BSD-licensed library that includes several hundreds
of computer vision algorithms. It is designed for computational
efficiency with strong focus on real-time application.

The OpenCV 3.1 release provides a transparent API that allows seamless
offloads of OpenCL kernels when a supported accelerator is available.
Documentation, tutorials and examples of how to use OpenCV 3.1 are
available `here <http://docs.opencv.org/3.1.0/#gsc.tab=0>`__.


This document outlines the specifics of how to test OpenCV that has
been released within Processor SDK. This release is based off OpenCV
3.1.


OpenCV implementation is available for the following TI devices:

-  AM335X
-  AM437X
-  AM57X/DRA7xx
-  K2E
-  K2H
-  K2L
-  K2G

To meet the requirements of real-time processing of images and video
OpenCV functions were optimized.

More-ever, TI’s OpenCV implementation of hybrid ARM-DSP devices (AM57X,
K2E, K2H, K2L, K2G) provides very efficient implementation of OpenCV
function where signal-processing-rich algorithms are processed by DSP
while the ARM processes all other algorithms, controls and manages the
DSP.

TI implementation of OpenCV contains implementation of OpenCV functions
as well as a set of unit tests to verify the performances and the
accuracy of the implementation.

This document provides instructions show how to load and run unit tests
of TI’s OpenCV implementation.

=================================
OpenCL offload
=================================

OpenCV 3.1 provides a transparent API that allows seamless offloads of
OpenCL kernels when a supported hardware accelerator is available.
OpenCV 3.1 available with Processor SDK allows these OpenCL kernels to
be offloaded to the C66x DSP.

OpenCV 3.1 supports approximately 200+ OpenCL kernels that optimize key
functionalities in the different modules. The OpenCL kernel offload
through the transparent API is enabled by the UMat data structure that
replaces the legacy Mat data structure. UMat uses the OpenCL memory
allocation procedure whenever possible, but maintains backward
compatibility with Mat data structure. Additional explanation can be
found on OpenCV site: https://opencv.org/platforms/opencl.html (or
others URL if you search for "OpenCV transparent API").

Within the context of Processor SDK, to enable the offload of OpenCL
kernels in OpenCV 3.1, the environment variable OPENCV\_OPENCL\_DEVICE
should be defined as follows:

For K2 Platforms export OPENCV\_OPENCL\_DEVICE='TI KeyStone
II:ACCELERATOR:TI Multicore C66 DSP'

For AM57x Platforms export OPENCV\_OPENCL\_DEVICE='TI
AM57:ACCELERATOR:TI Multicore C66 DSP'

If this environment variable is not defined properly then OpenCV will
not initialize OpenCL and the OpenCL support is disabled.

Further, the library user can enable/disable OpenCL at runtime (at
higher granularity, e.g. to let only part of program to do OpenCL
offload) using ocl::setUseOpenCL(true) or ocl::setUseOpenCL(false)
routines.

More OpenCL specific environment variables can affect the behavior.
Please refer to:
http://downloads.ti.com/mctools/esd/docs/opencl/environment_variables.html

.. note::
   The script setupEnv.sh, part of the SDK release (in
   /usr/share/OpenCV/titestsuite), defines the appropriate environment
   variables OPENCV\_OPENCL\_DEVICE as well as other environment variables
   that are needed for the unit tests.**

Figure 1 shows the decision tree the transparent API executes to
determine if the computations will be offloaded to the accelerator
through OpenCL. The boxes that are shaded gray are specific to TI’s
implementation of OpenCV. The prohibited list allows us to prevent
certain OpenCL kernels from executing on the DSP. The kernels are
prevented to execute on the DSP if they did not pass the accuracy tests.


.. Image:: /images/FlowChart3.jpg

.. rubric:: Example of OpenCL offload
   :name: example-of-opencl-offload

Here is a simple image processing example, using OpenCL dispatch via
Transparent API (Color-to-Gray, Gaussian Blur and Canny kernels).

::

     #include <opencv2/imgproc/imgproc.hpp>
     #include <opencv2/highgui/highgui.hpp>
     #include <opencv2/core/ocl.hpp>
     #include <time.h>
     #include <unistd.h>
     /* Time difference calculation, in ms units */
     double tdiff_calc(struct timespec &tp_start, struct timespec &tp_end)
     {
       return (double)(tp_end.tv_nsec -tp_start.tv_nsec) * 0.000001 + (double)(tp_end.tv_sec - tp_start.tv_sec) * 1000.0;
     }
     using namespace cv;
     int main(int argc, char** argv)
     {
       struct timespec tp0, tp1, tp2, tp3;
       UMat img, gray;
       imread("lena.png", 1).copyTo(img);
       clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &tp0);
       cvtColor(img, gray, COLOR_BGR2GRAY);
       clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &tp1);
       GaussianBlur(gray, gray, Size(5, 5), 1.25);
       clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &tp2);
       Canny(gray, gray, 0, 30);
       clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &tp3);
       printf ("BGR2GRAY  tdiff=%lf ms \n", tdiff_calc(tp0, tp1));
       printf ("GaussBlur tdiff=%lf ms \n", tdiff_calc(tp1, tp2));
       printf ("Canny     tdiff=%lf ms \n", tdiff_calc(tp2, tp3));
       imwrite("canny_proc.jpg", gray);
       return 0;
     }

It can be compiled on target (AM57xx), using following command:

::

     g++ -I/usr/local/include/opencv -I/usr/local/include/opencv2 -L/usr/local/lib/ -g -o canny_ex1 canny_ex1.cpp -lrt -lopencv_core -lopencv_imgproc -lopencv_video -lopencv_features2d -lopencv_imgcodecs

Execution can be launched using following script, showing execution time
with OpenCL dispatch respectively enabled and disabled:

::

     export TI_OCL_LOAD_KERNELS_ONCHIP=Y
     export TI_OCL_CACHE_KERNELS=Y
     export OPENCV_OPENCL_DEVICE='TI AM57:ACCELERATOR:TI Multicore C66 DSP'
     echo "OpenCL on, canny"
     ./canny_ex1
     export OPENCV_OPENCL_DEVICE='disabled'
     echo "OpenCL off, canny"
     ./canny_ex

Please note that the first run, with OpenCL on, has additional delay of
~1min, due to kernel compilation on AM57xx. This is constrained to first
run only, if "TI\_OCL\_CACHE\_KERNELS" environemnt variable is set.
Profiling shows different execution time for DSP (OpenCL on) and A15
(OpenCL off) platforms.

::

     OpenCL on, canny
     BGR2GRAY  tdiff=12.064661 ms
     GaussBlur tdiff=5.948558 ms
     Canny     tdiff=5.788493 ms
     OpenCL off, canny
     BGR2GRAY  tdiff=4.158085 ms
     GaussBlur tdiff=2.989813 ms
     Canny     tdiff=9.780171 ms

A15 loading (measured with 'top') during repeated execution with 'OpenCL
on', is in 50-60% range (single CPU load). A15 loading (measured with
'top') during repeated execution with 'OpenCL off', is in 150-170% range
(both CPUs loaded).

It is possible to make finer grained mapping of individual kernel
execution (some kernels could be mapped to DSP, others to A15 only).
Here is an example:

.. code-block:: cpp

     #include <opencv2/imgproc/imgproc.hpp>
     #include <opencv2/highgui/highgui.hpp>
     #include <opencv2/core/ocl.hpp>
     #include <time.h>
     #include <unistd.h>
     using namespace cv;
     /* Time difference calculation, in ms units */
     double tdiff_calc(struct timespec &tp_start, struct timespec &tp_end)
     {
       return (double)(tp_end.tv_nsec -tp_start.tv_nsec) * 0.000001 + (double)(tp_end.tv_sec - tp_start.tv_sec) * 1000.0;
     }
     int main(int argc, char** argv)
     {
       struct timespec tp0, tp1, tp2, tp3, tp4;
       Mat  img_mat;
       UMat img, gray;
       imread("lena.png", 1).copyTo(img_mat);
       cv::ocl::setUseOpenCL(false); /* suspend dispatch to DSP - from now on kernels are executed on A15 only! */
       clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &tp0);
       cvtColor(img_mat, img_mat, COLOR_BGR2GRAY);
       clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &tp1);
       cv::ocl::setUseOpenCL(true); /* resume DSP dispatch - from now on kernels, based on above decision tree, can be dispatched to DSP */
       img_mat.copyTo(gray);
       clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &tp2);
       GaussianBlur(gray, gray,Size(5, 5), 1.25);
       clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &tp3);
       Canny(gray, gray, 0, 30);
       clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &tp4);
       printf ("BGR2GRAY  tdiff=%lf ms \n", tdiff_calc(tp0, tp1));
       printf ("Copy2UMat tdiff=%lf ms \n", tdiff_calc(tp1, tp2));
       printf ("GaussBlur tdiff=%lf ms \n", tdiff_calc(tp2, tp3));
       printf ("Canny     tdiff=%lf ms \n", tdiff_calc(tp3, tp4));
       imwrite("canny_proc.jpg", gray);
       return 0;
     }

Unit Tests
=================================

Each function in the OpenCV implementation has a unit test associate
with the function.
The following instructions show how to load and run unit tests of TI’s
OpenCV implementation.
The screen shots and device dependent instructions in this document
are from AM57X build and run and can be used as a reference for build
and run OpenCV test for any other TI devices from the above list

.. rubric:: Unit Tests Prerequisites
   :name: unit-tests-prerequisites

OpenCV function unit test can run on any of TI devices that were
mentioned above. This document describes how to run the unit test on
AM57X family of TI devices. The screen shots were taken from a
Tera-terminal connected to AM5728 EVM.

.. rubric:: Prerequisites
   :name: prerequisites

.. rubric:: Loading Standard Test Data
   :name: loading-standard-test-data

The standard test code data opencv\_extra-master.zip can be downloaded
from
`here <https://github.com/Itseez/opencv_extra/archive/master.zip>`__

.. rubric:: Procedure to Get the Test Data
   :name: procedure-to-get-the-test-data

There are multiple ways to download the data into the EVM

::

       If the EVM has display and keyboard the user can downloaded
       the data compressed file directly to the EVM and then unzip it
       Otherwise download the data compressed file to a PC on the network and
       use SCP or tftp or USB memory stick to move the data compressed file into the EVM.


The following screen shots show how to download the standard data
compressed file into the EVM and unzip it. It assumes that there is a
TFTP master server, for example Solarwinds or similar, and that the
file opencv\_extra-master.zip was downloaded from
https://github.com/Itseez/opencv_extra/archive/master.zip and resides
in the root directory of the TFTP server. The beginning of the unzip
process and the end of the unzip process are shown in the screen shots
as well.

The TFTP command is tftp -g -r opencv\_extra-master.zip
xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx where xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx stands for the IP address of the
TFTP server. Note that the process takes few minutes because the file
is very large. (More than 600MB)

.. rubric:: Summary of Getting the Data Steps
   :name: summary-of-getting-the-data-steps

|

#. Boot the EVM and login as root.
#. Change directory to /usr/share/OpenCV
#. Get the opencv\_extra-master.zip file from a server as described
   above
#. unzip the opencv\_extra-master.zip file
#. Delete the opencv\_extra-master.zip file

|

After unzip the file a new directory ***opencv\_extra-master*** is
generated. A sub-directory ***testdata*** should be moved up one
level.

From the OpenCV directory do the following: ***mv
opencv\_extra-master/testdata .*** . See the screen shot below.

.. Image:: /images/MoveTestdata.jpg

.. rubric:: Environment Settings and Run the Tests
   :name: environment-settings-and-run-the-tests


The script setupEnv.sh in directory /usr/share/OpenCV/titestsuite sets
the environment variables that are needed for the unit tests.

From the OpenCV directory do the following: ***cd titestsuit*** and
then ***source ./setupEnv.sh*** . See the screen shot below.

.. Image:: /images/Environment1.jpg

The script runtests run all the unit tests. From the titestsuit
directory do ***./runtests*** . The unit tests starts executing. The
screen will show the following:

.. Image:: /images/RunTests1.jpg

#. Currently the last three tests in the script (videoio) do not run on
   AM57X. The script will stuck after about 90 minutes. The user can
   stop the script ("control C") or eliminate the videoio tests
#. An output log file opencv\_test\_log.out is generated in directory
   /usr/share/OpenCV/titestsuite. The start of the log file looks like
   the following:

Necessary steps to modify OpenCV framework to add more OpenCL Host side and DSP C66 optimized kernels
=======================================================================================================

Primary purpose of this tutorial is to show how one can add TI DSP C66
optimized kernels to existing OpenCV framework. Necessary steps are
described in below paragraphs, describing several already optimized
kernels, and also how to add new and then recompile and deploy updated
OpenCV in PLSDK 3.1. TI DSP specific OpenCL implementation is additional
to few existing accelerators: Intel x86: SSE2/SSE4/AVX/AVX2 extensions;
ARM: NEON; nVIDIA: CUDA; Generic OpenCL. Range of accelerated kernels
via OpenCL is wide, e.g. OpenCV 3.10 baseline includes ~200 kernels
encoded in OpenCL C. TI OpenCL (C66 core) follows 1.2 version of
standard, and can execute baseline OpenCV OpenCL kernels (as-is!). But
additional performance improvements can be achieved by using TI DSP
OpenCL extensions (intrinsics and EDMAmgr).

--------------------
Supported Platforms
--------------------

See `here <Release_Specific_Supported_Platforms_and_Versions.html>`__ for a list
of supported platforms and links to more information.
OpenCL dispatch is available only on platforms with DSP C66 core, like
AM5728 (2 C66 cores).

-----------------------------
OpenCV OpenCL run-time setup
-----------------------------

OpenCV and OpenCL are already included in PLSDK 3.10. OpenCV uses
run-time compilation of OpenCL kernels, so first time kernel execution
is dominated by kernel compilation (later they are cached either in
memory or tmp filesystem) - please note that it may take several dozens
of seconds on AM5728EVM. In order to enable OpenCL acceleration inside
OpenCV, following environment variable need to be set (example applies
to AM57xx): **export OPENCV\_OPENCL\_DEVICE='TI AM57:ACCELERATOR:TI
Multicore C66 DSP'**

-  For additional information, please refer to:
   `OpenCL User Guide <Foundational_Components_OpenCL.html>`__

--------------------------------
OpenCV OpenCL development setup
--------------------------------

OpenCV and OpenCL are already included in PLSDK 3.10.

-  Development setup need to be prepared based on
   `Building the Processor SDK <Overview_Building_the_SDK.html>`__
-  When needed, source code under the work directory (e.g.,
   arago-tmp-[toolchain]/work/am57xx\_evm-linux-gnueabi/opencv/git) can
   be modified.
-  Forced compilation can be started, after code modification:

::

     ARAGO_BRAND=processor-sdk MACHINE=am57xx-evm bitbake opencv --force -c compile
    ARAGO_BRAND=processor-sdk MACHINE=am57xx-evm bitbake opencv

-  To install modified package (not all OpenCV ipk-s are changed),
   select updated packages in
   arago-tmp-[toolchain]/work/am57xx\_evm-linux-gnueabi/opencv//am57xx\_evm
   and install on target system using:

::

     opkg install libopencv-<modulename.version.commit>-r0.tisdk4_am57xx_evm.ipk

----------------------------------------------------------------------
OpenCV OpenCL related framework details: how to add new DSP kernel
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Addition of a new kernel includes two steps: addition of Host (A15) side
modification, and new DSP kernel (to be described in next chapter).

-  OpenCL dispatch is attempted with macro **CV\_OCL\_RUN\_()**, from top
   level function of specific OpenCV kernel. If OpenCV OpenCL dispatch
   fails, or some preconditions are not met, it falls back to Native C
   implementation).
-  Host side OpenCL wrapper function are placed in modules/XYZ folder,
   in same file along with implementation for other architectures (e.g.
   Native C, SSE/AVX or Neon). Function can be identified with "ocl\_"
   prefix, e.g. ocl\_threshold() (modules/imgproc/src/threshold.cpp) or
   ocl\_apply (modules/video/src/bgfg\_gaussmix2.cpp). Inside this
   wrapper function, conditions for successful execution on DSP need to
   be met. This typically includes checking data types, number of
   channels, and/or image size.
-  At this point kernel build options can be set in run-time
   (compilation is always done before first kernel dispatch). They are
   provided as string in Kernel class member variable kdefs. In this way
   additional optimizations can be applied (e.g. skipping parts of code,
   or setting parameters as constants).
-  Kernel file name (where kernel is defined) is set in 2nd argument of
   kernel constructor, with "\_oclsrc" postfix: e.g.
   **ocl::imgproc::threshold\_oclsrc** - this means that kernel body is
   defined in "./opencl/threshold.cl" file. This operation is performed
   during configuration stage of OpenCV build.
-  Kernel execution is invoked via run() method (of Kernel class). All
   kernel arguments need to be passed before this method is invoked.
   This typically includes source and destination buffers, and any
   additional argument affecting kernel execution (scalars, temporary
   buffers allocated on the host side, etc.). Arguments (order, data
   types, etc) need to match kernel implementation. Global and local
   sizes used in invocation of kernel, are almost always vectors with 2
   elements indicating 2D operation. Global size vector indicate total
   number of items to be processed, whereas local size vector indicate
   size of work group, i.e. number of elements (across both dimensions)
   in single task. In below examples, we set global size to {2,1} and
   local size to {1,1}, forcing creation of only two DSP tasks by OpenCL
   framework. In this way complete control is passed to the developer to
   kernel, and only ensuring that two tasks can be launched in parallel.

As a reference you can look for ocl\_XYZ functions including
preprocessor conditional #ifdef TIOPENCL (in modules/\*/src files).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Creating OpenCL C kernel optimized for C66 core
----------------------------------------------------------------------

DSP specific implementation of kernel body can be placed in existing
XXX.cl or new YYY.cl file - both have to be placed in
modules/ZZZ/src/opencl folder. No modification of top level CMake files
are required (all .cl files present in ./opencl folder are included in
compilaton). There are three options in adding new kernel
implementation:

-  If we decide to use existing file and kernel name, we can use macro
   set in kernel build options (refer to previous paragraph) - example
   in: modules/video/src/bgfg\_gaussmix2.cpp:

::

     ...
        String opts = format("-D CN=%d -D NMIXTURES=%d%s -DTIDSP_MOG2 -D SUBLINE_CACHE=%d", nchannels, nmixtures, bShadowDetection ? " -DSHADOW_DETECT" : "", subline_cache);
        kernel_apply.create("mog2_kernel", ocl::video::bgfg_mog2_oclsrc, opts);
    ...

to select baseline or DSP specific implementation - example in:
modules/video/src/opencl/bgfg\_mog2.cl:

.. code-block:: cpp

     #ifdef TIDSP_MOG2
    TI DSP specific implementation
    ...
    __kernel void mog2_kernel(__global const uchar* frame, int frame_step, int frame_offset, int frame_row, int frame_col,  //uchar || uchar3
                            __global uchar* modesUsed,                                                                    //uchar
                            __global uchar* weight,                                                                       //float
                            __global uchar* mean,                                                                         //T_MEAN=float || float4
                            __global uchar* variance,                                                                     //float
                            __global uchar* fgmask, const int fgmask_step, const int fgmask_offset,                       //uchar
                            const float alphaT, const float alpha1, const float prune,
                            const float c_Tb, const float c_TB, float c_Tg, const float c_varMin,                         //constants
                            const float c_varMax, const float c_varInit, const float c_tau
     #ifdef SHADOW_DETECT
                            , const uchar c_shadowVal
     #endif
                            )
    ...
    #else
    OPENCL generic implementation:
    ...
    __kernel void mog2_kernel(__global const uchar* frame, int frame_step, int frame_offset, int frame_row, int frame_col,  //uchar || uchar3
                            __global uchar* modesUsed,                                                                    //uchar
                            __global uchar* weight,                                                                       //float
                            __global uchar* mean,                                                                         //T_MEAN=float || float4
                            __global uchar* variance,                                                                     //float
                            __global uchar* fgmask, int fgmask_step, int fgmask_offset,                                   //uchar
                            float alphaT, float alpha1, float prune,
                            float c_Tb, float c_TB, float c_Tg, float c_varMin,                                           //constants
                            float c_varMax, float c_varInit, float c_tau
    #ifdef SHADOW_DETECT
                            , uchar c_shadowVal
    #endif
                            )
    ...
    #endif

-  Another option is to use different kernel name, and use it
   appropriately as mentioned in previous paragraph.

.. code-block:: cpp

       TI DSP specific implementation
    __attribute__((reqd_work_group_size(1,1,1))) __kernel void tidsp_morph_erode (__global const uchar * srcptr, int src_step, int src_offset,
                      __global uchar * dstptr, int dst_step, int dst_offset,
                      int src_offset_x, int src_offset_y, int cols, int rows,
                      int src_whole_cols, int src_whole_rows)

.. code-block:: cpp

     ...
    __attribute__((reqd_work_group_size(1,1,1))) __kernel void tidsp_morph_dilate (__global const uchar * srcptr, int src_step, int src_offset,
                      __global uchar * dstptr, int dst_step, int dst_offset,
                      int src_offset_x, int src_offset_y, int cols, int rows,
                      int src_whole_cols, int src_whole_rows)

|

.. code-block:: cpp

       OpenCL generic implementation
    __kernel void morph(__global const uchar * srcptr, int src_step, int src_offset,
                      __global uchar * dstptr, int dst_step, int dst_offset,
                      int src_offset_x, int src_offset_y, int cols, int rows,
                      int src_whole_cols, int src_whole_rows EXTRA_PARAMS)

|

-  Third option is to create new file and use it in kernel constructor,
   with \_oclsrc postfix (as mentioned in previous paragraph), like used
   in modules/imgproc/src/smooth.cpp

::

       TI DSP specific OpenCL implementation
    ...
      cv::String kname = format( "tidsp_gaussian" ) ;
      cv::String kdefs = format("-D T=%s -D T1=%s -D cn=%d", ocl::typeToStr(type), ocl::typeToStr(depth), cn) ;
      ocl::Kernel k(kname.c_str(), ocl::imgproc::gauss_oclsrc, kdefs.c_str() );
    ...

Implementation for this OpenCL kernel is provided in
modules/imgproc/src/opencl/gauss.cl, which is a new file.

DSP kernels can use standard 1.2 OpenCL C and DSP specific extensions.
OpenCL included in PLSDK 3.1 allows direct use of functions in edmamgr
module. We can even use printf() in .cl files (developer does not need
to bother with any additional hooks on Host side) which is very useful
for development, debugging and benchmarking.

.. code-block:: cpp

     ...
    #ifdef TIDSP_OPENCL_VERBOSE
      clk_end = __clock();
      printf ("TIDSP dilate clockdiff=%d\n", clk_end - clk_start);
    #endif
    ...

Output looks like:

::

     [core 1] TIDSP dilate clockdiff=532646
    [core 0] TIDSP dilate clockdiff=531362

----------------------------------------------------------------------
OpenCV OpenCL kernels implemented specifically for DSP C66 core
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Coding in OpenCL C is very close to coding in Native DSP C (cl6x). Many
platform specific details are automatically resolved with OpenCL tools
(like memory map handling, header file inclusion, etc) and framework
(loading, buffer transfer). OpenCV is based on run-time compilation of
OpenCL kernels provided in source, and preprocessed and converted to
header and CPP arrays during configure stage. But, it is also possible
to use off-line compilation or link with Native DSP C libraries. TI DSP
OpenCL supports 1.2 standard and several DSP extensions. In order to
achieve maximum performance, majority of techniques applicable in DSP C
are applicable in OpenCL C:

-  DSP intrinsics.

.. code-block:: cpp

           ...
          /* Convert from 8bpp to 16bpp so we can do SIMD of rows \*/
          r0_2 = _dmpyu4(as_uchar8(r0), as_uchar8(mask1_8));  /* 8-way unsigned 8-bit X 8-bit multiplication \*/
          r1_2 = _dmpyu4(as_uchar8(r1), as_uchar8(mask2_8));
          r2_2 = _dmpyu4(as_uchar8(r2), as_uchar8(mask1_8));
          /* Add rows 0+1, column-wise \*/
          r01_lo = _dadd2(as_long(r0_2.s0123), as_long(r1_2.s0123));
          r01_hi = _dadd2(as_long(r0_2.s4567), as_long(r1_2.s4567));
          ...

-  Multi-DSP core operation - splitting work load by partitioning input
   data

.. code-block:: cpp

     int   gid   = get_global_id(0); /* 1st dimension can be used to identify DSP core */

-  It is highly advisable to copy input data to L2 or even L1 memory.
   Use EDMA to parallelize data transfers (from DDR to/from L2) with DSP
   core execution

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
EDMA transfer framework
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is essential that EDMA operates in parallel with DSP core operation,
so that DSP core always have ready data to be processed. This can be
accomplished with well known "ping-pong" scheme at input end. It is
possible to implement similar method at output end of operation, but
typically there are much fewer write operations. Several kernels include
"EDMA image processing framework": it ensures that several consecutive
image rows are transferred to L2 memory and ready to be processed by DSP
core. In order to avoid redundant copies, an array of pointers to
beginning of image rows is maintained. Main unit of operation is single
image row. Only one image row is in-flight, both on input and output.
Still, DSP processing (which is typical use case) may use multiple
consecutive image rows. Examples of this framework can be found in:
gauss.cl, sobel.cl, thresh.cl in tiopencv repository (http://git.ti.com/opencv/tiopencv/trees/tiopencvrelease_3.1)

-  Initialization: resetting L2 image rows

::

     for(i = 0; i < (LINES_CACHED + 1); i ++)
    {
      memset ((void \*)img_lines[i], 0, MAX_LINE_SIZE);
    }

-  Partitioning data between DSP cores

.. code-block:: c

     ...
    int   gid   = get_global_id(0);  /* Identify DSP core: gid is set to 0 for 1st DSP core, and 1 for 2nd DSP core \*/
    ...

::

     if(gid == 0)
    { /* Upper half of image \*/
      for(i = 1; i < LINES_CACHED; i ++)
      { /* Use this, one time multiple 1D1D transfers, instead of one linked transfer, to allow for fast EDMA later \*/
        EdmaMgr_copy1D1D(evIN, (void \*)(srcptr + (rows - 1 + i) * cols), (void \*)(img_lines[i]), cols);
      }
      fetch_rd_idx = cols;
    } else if(gid == 1)
    { /* Bottom half of image \*/
      for(i = 0; i < LINES_CACHED; i ++)
      { /* Use this, one time multiple 1D1D transfers, instead of one linked transfer, to allow for fast EDMA later \*/
        EdmaMgr_copy1D1D(evIN, (void \*)(srcptr + (rows - 1 + i) * cols), (void \*)(img_lines[i]), cols);
      }
      fetch_rd_idx = (rows + 1) * cols;
      dest_ptr += rows * cols;
    } else return;
    start_rd_idx = 0;

-  Main image row loop

::

     for (int y = 0; y < rows; y ++)
    {
      EdmaMgr_wait(evIN);
      rd_idx  = start_rd_idx;
      for(kk = 0; kk < LINES_CACHED; kk ++)
      {
        y_ptr[kk] = (uchar \*)img_lines[rd_idx];
        rd_idx = (rd_idx + 1) & LINES_CACHED;
      }
      start_rd_idx = (start_rd_idx + 1) & LINES_CACHED;
      EdmaMgr_copyFast(evIN, (void*)(srcptr + fetch_rd_idx), (void*)(img_lines[rd_idx]));
      fetch_rd_idx += cols;
      /**********************************************************************************/
      yprev_ptr = y_ptr[0];
      ycurr_ptr = y_ptr[1];
      ynext_ptr = y_ptr[2];
      ...
      /* Access L2 data directly using yprev_ptr, ycurr_ptr, ynext_ptr... \*/

Alternative approach to add new OpenCL kernels at OpenCV application level
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Instead of adding OpenCL kernels into OpenCV framework, it is possible
to do that directly from OpenCV application. This approach might be
preferred if scope and reuse of work are limited. Primary benefit is
more direct control of development (avoid OpenCV framework complexities)
and reduced build time (only top level application and specific kernels
need to be recompiled instead of doing Yocto builds). Building the
application (below example is executed on target) is straightforward:

.. code-block:: c

    g++ -I/usr/local/include/opencv -I/usr/local/include/opencv2 -g -c  cvclapp-direct.cpp
    g++ -I/usr/local/include/opencv -I/usr/local/include/opencv2 -L/usr/local/lib/ -g -o cvclapp \
         cvclapp.cpp \
         cvclapp-direct.o \
         -lrt \
         -lopencv_core \
         -lopencv_imgproc \
         -lopencv_highgui \
         -lopencv_ml \
         -lopencv_video \
         -lopencv_features2d \
         -lopencv_calib3d \
         -lopencv_objdetect \
         -lopencv_imgcodecs \
         -lOpenCL -locl_util

Below two sections show how OpenCL kernels can be dispatched from OpenCV
application in two different ways.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
OpenCL kernel dispatch from OpenCV application, using existing OpenCV-OpenCL classes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

OpenCV host side code, using OpenCV classes (defined in
modules/core/src/ocl.cpp) to load and dispatch OpenCL kernels (online
compilation).

        if (!ocl::haveOpenCL())

            cout << "OpenCL is not avaiable..." << endl;
            return 0;
        }

        ocl::Kernel kernel("invert_img", program);
        // Transfer Mat data to the device
        Mat mat_src = imread("lena.png", IMREAD_GRAYSCALE);

        UMat umat_dst(mat_src.size(), mat_src.type(), ACCESS_WRITE, USAGE_ALLOCATE_DEVICE_MEMORY);
        kernel.args(ocl::KernelArg::ReadOnlyNoSize(umat_src), ocl::KernelArg::ReadWrite(umat_dst));
        size_t globalThreads[2] = { (unsigned int)mat_src.cols, (unsigned int)mat_src.rows };
        size_t localThreads[2] = { 16, 16 };
        bool success = kernel.run(2, globalThreads, localThreads, false);
        if (!success){
          cout << "Failed running the kernel..." << endl;
          return 0;
        } else {
          cout << "Kernel OK!" << endl;
        }
        GaussianBlur(umat_dst, umat_dst, Size(5, 5), 1.25);
        Canny(umat_dst, umat_dst, 0, 50);
        // Fetch the dst data from the device
        Mat mat_dst = umat_dst.getMat(ACCESS_READ);
        imwrite("out1.jpg", mat_dst);
        ProcRawCL(mat_src, "kernel_direct.cl");
    //    imshow("src", mat_src);
    //    imshow("dst", mat_dst);
    //    waitKey();
        return 1;
    }

loaded and compiled by above host program.

OpenCV profiling - standard procedure
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Standard procedure for profiling OpenCV kernels (with OpenCL dispatch or
without), is described in:
https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/HowToUsePerfTests In case of
Processor Linux SDK on AM3/4/5 (AM57xx only supports OpenCL dispatch to
DSP cores), these steps should be followed:

::

       [EVM] cd /usr/share/OpenCV/titestsuite
       [EVM] source setupEnv.txt
       [LINUXBOX] Copy test vectors (copy https://github.com/opencv/opencv_extra/tree/master/testdata) to [EVM] /usr/share/OpenCV/testdata
       [LINUXBOX] We need Yocto build (follow http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Processor_SDK_Building_The_SDK)
           as opencv performance executables or scripts are not distributed, as standard deliverables:
           From Yocto build, copy all python scripts from opencv/XYZ/git/modules/ts/misc, to EVM folder: /usr/share/OpenCV/titestsuite
           From Yocto build, copy opencv_perf_* executables from opencv/XYZ/build/bin, to EVM folder: /usr/share/OpenCV/titestsuite
       [EVM] Use environment variable to enable / disable OpenCL kernel acceleration:
           OPENCL off:
               export OPENCV_OPENCL_DEVICE='
           OPENCL on:
               export TI_OCL_CACHE_KERNELS=Y
               export TI_OCL_KEEP_FILES=Y
               export OPENCV_OPENCL_DEVICE='TI AM57:ACCELERATOR:TI Multicore C66 DSP'
       [EVM] Now we are ready to run the tests, or subsets of tests:
           EXAMPLE (EVM, execute from folder /usr/share/OpenCV/titestsuite): python ./run.py -t objdetect (run objdetect module performance tests)
           EXAMPLE (EVM, execute from folder /usr/share/OpenCV/titestsuite): python ./run.py -t core,imgproc (run both core and imgproc performance tests... this takes a lot of time)
           EXAMPLE (EVM, execute from folder /usr/share/OpenCV/titestsuite): python ./run.py --perf_force_samples=5 -t imgproc --gtest_filter="*Sobel*" (run only Sobel filters from imgproc module)
           EXAMPLE (EVM, execute from folder /usr/share/OpenCV/titestsuite): python ./run.py --gtest_list_tests -t imgproc (list all the available performance tests, for imgproc module)
           EXAMPLE (EVM, execute from folder /usr/share/OpenCV/titestsuite): python ./run.py --perf_force_samples=5 -t imgproc --gtest_filter="*threshold/20*" (run single test case)

Frequently Asked Questions
=================================

**How to compile OpenCV natively on 66AK2H platform?**

    The ARM gcc compiler is included in the ProcSDK filesystem under /usr/bin directory.
    OpenCV is supported on Keystone2 platforms (K2H/K/E/L). However, the following OpenCV include files
    and libraries are not in the filesystem, but needed to compile natively.

    Libraries need to be copied from
    Linux_ProSDK/linux-devkit/sysroot/armv7ahf-neon-linux-gnueabi/usr/lib to /usr/lib are::

         libopencv*
         libgst*
         libgphoto*
         liborc*
         libtbb*
         libwebp*
         libtiff*
         libgst*
         libgphoto*
         libexif*
         liborc*

    OpenCV include directories need to be copied from
    Linux_ProSDK/linux-devkit/sysroot/armv7ahf-neon-linux-gnueabi/usr/include to /usr/include are::

         opencv
         opencv2

    Once all the libraries and include files are copied, the OpenCV example, canny_ex1, can be compiled natively on EVM..

**Why the performance of running on DSP offloaded using OpenCL is slower than that running on ARM using OpenMP?**

    Unless the system can hide somewhat the data movement
    (using DMA to move data while some other computations are taking place)
    this is data movement problem. Each of the cores, DSP and the ARM are capable of
    doing floating point multiplication and addition in a single step
    (in pipeline fashion) so really the bottle neck is the data in and out the DDR,
    2M 32-bit elements of two vectors read and one vector write must reside in the DDR
    (or generated on the fly)

    Since this is data movement problem and not processing problem, it is not expected that
    the DSP to be much faster, unless the ARM is busy doing something else at the same time.
    So the advantage of the OpenCL in this case is that the ARM can do something else
    while the DSP is busy performing the (so simple) algorithm.

**When using UMat to do remap, it shows faster than using Mat, but why UMat time cost of saving results is longer than Mat?**

    When OpenCL is turned on and if data are in UMat, remap is directed to DSP,
    i.e. offload to DSP happens, but OpenCL in OpenCV has somewhat different call flow.
    It submits a task (to DSP OpenCL queue) and returns immediately.
    This allows parallelization between accelerator (DSP) and CPU,
    as long as data dependency is satisfied.  So, when save is requested,
    CPU waits for end of submitted task before it can actually do the save.
    DSP in many cases is slower than A15 (NEON operation). The UMat cost time includes:
    waiting time (for DSP to finish) plus actual write and any format conversion (done on CPU).
    It also depends a lot on data types used, and if floating point operations are involved.
    This can be accelerated if DSP optimized implementation of remap() is created.

    To optimize DSP, please follow guideline in Chapters
    `Creating OpenCL C kernel optimized for C66 core
    <Foundational_Components_OpenCV.html#creating-opencl-c-kernel-optimized-for-c66-core>`__ to
    `Alternative approach to add new OpenCL kernels at OpenCV application level
    <Foundational_Components_OpenCV.html#alternative-approach-to-add-new-opencl-kernels-at-opencv-application-level>`__


**Why isn't the performance improved when calling dsplib and use OpenMP to accelerate?**


    There is overhead involved in dispatching compute to the DSP.
    If the amount of compute in the offloaded region is small, the user can notice a slowdown.
    The "null" OpenMPAcc example that ships on the target file system
    (/usr/share/ti/examples/openmpacc/) can be run to determine the overhead involved in
    dispatching a target region.
