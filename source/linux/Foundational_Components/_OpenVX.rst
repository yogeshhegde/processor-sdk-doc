.. rubric:: OpenVX
   :name: openvx

OpenVX is an open, Khronos (https://www.khronos.org/openvx/) defined
standard for cross platform acceleration of computer vision
applications. OpenVX enables performance and power-optimized computer
vision processing, with emphasis on embedded and real-time use cases:

-  advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS)
-  face, body and gesture tracking
-  smart video surveillance
-  object and scene reconstruction
-  augmented reality
-  visual inspection
-  robotics and more.

Though originally intended for vision only embedded applications, it may
be extended in future to non-vision applications suitable for data flow
representation.

.. rubric:: TIOVX
   :name: tiovx

TIOVX is TI's implementation of OpenVX Standard.

TIOVX allows users to create vision and compute applications using
OpenVX API. These OpenVX applications can be executed on TI SoCs like
AM57xx (including A15 and C66 cores), following OpenVX 1.1 standard.
TIOVX also provides optimized OpenVX kernels for C66x DSP. An extension
API allows users to integrate their own natively developed custom
kernels and call them using OpenVX APIs.

There are two versions of VXLIB kernels: without BAM framework, and
with BAM framework. BAM is a low level framework representing directed
acyclic graph, where EDMA transfers are heavily utilized to bring 2D
memory objects to higher speed L2 memory, thus improving performance
almost twofold.

Current release has kernels with BAM framework. This framework
achieves higher performance via heavy use of EDMA, which brings blocks
of data from remote DDR memory to local L2, while DSP does the
processing. List of these kernels can be checked in
https://git.ti.com/processor-sdk/tiovx/trees/master/kernels/openvx-core/c66x/bam.

+--------------------------+--------------------------+--------------------------+

TIOVX release 1.0.0.0 runs exclusively wrt OpenCL, as both firmwares use
common resources DSP cores and CMEM memory. That is: application can be
either TIOVX-based, or OpenCL -based. Future releases may remove this
limitation and use static split in resources (between OpenCL and
OpenVX). **TIOVX needs CMEM memory with two blocks**: block 0 is big DDR
block for exchange of big buffers (>100MB) and block 1 (~1MB) which is
used as shared memory visible from all cores to exchange shared data
objects (typically in OCMC)

.. rubric:: Switch from OpenCL to OpenVX firmware:
   :name: switch-from-opencl-to-openvxfirmware

Run the command below to switch from OpenCL to OpenVx firmware:

::

    reload-dsp-fw.sh tiovx                   # load openvx firmware and restart dsps

.. rubric:: Run TIOVX test application
   :name: run-tiovx-test-application

First, it is necessary to copy test vectors from
https://git.ti.com/processor-sdk/tiovx/trees/master/conformance_tests/test_data
to EVM filesystem (e.g. ~/tiovx/test\_data).Then run following
commands:

::

    export VX_TEST_DATA_PATH=/home/root/tiovx/test_data  # Set environment variable to point to location of test vectors on EVM
    tiovx-app_host 2>&1 | tee log.txt                    # Run test application, and log output to log.txt

At the end of test (taking roughly 24mins) you can expect report like
this:

| Additional documentation can be found at
  https://git.ti.com/processor-sdk/tiovx/trees/master/docs
| TIOVX framework and TIOVX-APP can be recompiled like any other
  component, as described in
  http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Processor_SDK_Building_The_SDK.
  Optionally you can do full rebuild with:

::

    MACHINE=am57xx-evm bitbake tisdk-core-bundle

| For modifying individual components in PLSDK, please refer to: to
  http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Processor_SDK_Building_The_SDK#Recipes
| If there is a need to modify source code of TIOVX host library
  (framework) files (A15 side), please do that in:
  tisdk/build/arago-tmp-external-arm-toolchain/work/am57xx\_evm-linux-gnueabi/tiovx-lib-host/01.00.00.00-r1/git/
  folder.
| For example, to modify list of tests executed: update file
  ./tiovx/conformance\_tests/test\_tiovx/test\_main.h, or
  ./tiovx/conformance\_tests/test\_conformance/test\_main.h
| After the source modification, force compile the Library (Linux host
  side), and rebuild the package using:

::

    MACHINE=am57xx-evm bitbake tiovx-lib-host  -f -c compile

::

    MACHINE=am57xx-evm bitbake tiovx-lib-host

| Similarly application code can be modified in:
