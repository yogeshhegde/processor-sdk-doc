Filesystem
==========

The |__SDK_FULL_NAME__| provides a filesystem tarball that contains
programs, scripts, Linux user-space components that abstract various
hardware accelerators available in the SoC. The filesystem can be
built via Yocto, following the instructions
:ref:`Processor SDK - Building the SDK with Yocto <Overview_Building_the_SDK.html>`

There are different filesystem tarballs provided in the SDK. You'll find them at
:file:`${PSDK_PATH}/filesystem/`


.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_sdk in ('PLSDK')

    .. rubric:: tisdk-base-image

    This is the barebones images, intended to be a starting point for
    users to add packages and create a custom filesystem that suits their
    project needs.

    .. rubric:: tisdk-thinlinux-image

    This is a minimal system image enabled with containers to provide
    an environment to start the next level of complex systems up. Depending
    on the platform capabilities, graphics is enabled by default as well.


.. rubric:: tisdk-default-image

This is the complete filesystem image, that contains standard Linux
commands and features. This also contains the TI component libraries,
binaries and :ref:`TI Apps Launcher OOB Demo <TI-Apps-Launcher-User-Guide-label>`

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_sdk in ('PLSDK')

    .. ifconfig:: CONFIG_part_family in ('General_family')

        For keystone devices (e.g., K2H/K2K,
        K2E, K2L, and K2G), two filesystem tarballs are provided due to size
        limit of the rootfs ubi image:

        -  tisdk-server-rootfs-image-k2g-evm.tar.gz: base filesystem image used
           to create the ubi image.
        -  tisdk-server-extra-rootfs-image-k2g-evm.tar.gz: complete filesystem
           image that can be used with NFS and/or SD card (K2G only).

.. only:: _comment

    [comment] current SDK 7.x build for 'PLSDK' doesn't have docker/tiny image, so comment out the following section

    .. rubric:: tisdk-docker-rootfs-image

    This is a minimal image with support for Docker.
    See `Docker Linux Container Runtime <Foundational_Components/Virtualization/Docker.html>`__ for more information.

    .. rubric:: arago-tiny-image

    This is the absolute minimal filesystem. The boot files are omitted from this
    image and systemd has been replaced with sysvinit.


Following is a list of all filesystem images provided by TI which can be built via Yocto
