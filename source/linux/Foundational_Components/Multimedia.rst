.. rubric:: Introduction
   :name: introduction-linux-accelerated-multimedia

TI's embedded processors such as AM57xx have following hardware
accelerators.

-  IVA (Image and Video Accelerator) for accelerating multimedia encode
   and decode.
-  VPE (Video Processing Engine) for Scaling, Color Space Conversion and
   Deinterlacing.
-  C66x DSP cores for offloading certain image/video and/or voice/audio
   processing.

In order to make it easy for customers to write applications, and to
leverage open source elements that provide functionality such as AVI
stream demuxing, audio encode/decode, etc, TI's PROCESSOR-SDK supplies
ARM based GStreamer plugins that abstracts the hardware accelerator
offload.

This multimedia training page will cover the following topics.

-  Capabilities of IVA-HD, VPE, DSP, and ARM
-  Out of Box Multimedia Demos in PROCESSOR-SDK
-  Software Stack of Accerelated Codec Encoding/Decoding
-  Gstreamer Pipelines for Multimedia Applications
-  DSP C66x Gstreamer Plugin Internals

.. rubric:: Software Stack of Accelerated Codec Encoding/Decoding
   :name: software-stack-of-accelerated-codec-encodingdecoding

As shown in the figure below, the software stack of the accelerated
codec encoding/decoding runs on two subsystems: MPU subsystem on
ARM-A15, and IPU subsystem on ARM-M4. The two subsystems communicate
with each other through RPMSG. At the highest level in MPU subsystem on
ARM-A15, there is Linux user space application which is based on
Gstreamer. GStreamer is an open source framework that simplifies the
development of multimedia applications. The GStreamer library loads and
interfaces with the TI GStreamer plugin (GST-Ducati plugin), which
handles all the details specific to use of the hardware accelerator.
Specifically, TI GStreamer plugin interfaces libdce in user space. On
one hand, libdec interacts with libdrm in user space for displaying
video in Wayland window system. On the other hand, libdce interfaces
with RPMSG in Linux kernel to communicate with the IPU subsystem on
ARM-M4. The IPU subsystem builds on SYS/BIOS RTOS and runs IVAHD
video/image codecs, utilizing framework components and codec engine.

**Overview of the Multimedia Software Stack**

The Multimedia software contains many software components. Some are
developed by Texas Instruments and some are developed in and by the
open source community(White). TI contributes, and sometimes even
maintains, some of these open source community projects, but the
support model is different from a project developed solely by TI.

.. rubric:: Gstreamer Pipelines for Multimedia
   :name: gstreamer-pipelines-for-multimedia

.. rubric:: Open Source GStreamer Overview
   :name: open-source-gstreamer-overview

GStreamer is an open source framework that simplifies the development of
multimedia applications, such as media players and capture encoders. It
encapsulates existing multimedia software components, such as codecs,
filters, and platform-specific I/O operations, by using a standard
interface and providing a uniform framework across applications.

The modular nature of GStreamer facilitates the addition of new
functionality, transparent inclusion of component advancements and
allows for flexibility in application development and testing.
Processing nodes are implemented via Gstreamer plugins with several sink
and/or source pads. Many plugins are running as ARM software
implementation, but for more complex SoCs certain functions are better
executed on hardware accelerated IPs like IVAHD (video codecs) or VPE.

Gstreamer is multimedia framework based on data flow paradigm. It allows
easy plugin registration just by deploying new shared objects to
/usr/lib/gstreamer-1.0 folder. The shared libraries in this folder are
scanned for reserved data structures identifying capabilities of
individual plugins. Individual processing nodes can be interconnected as
a pipeline in run-time creating complex topologies. Node interfacing
compatibility is verified at that time - before pipeline is started.

GStreamer brings a lot of value-added features to Processor SDK,
including audio encoding and decoding, audio and video synchronization,
interaction with a wide variety of open source plugins (muxers,
demuxers, codecs, and filters). New GStreamer features are continuously
being added, and the core libraries are actively supported by
participants in the GStreamer community. Additional information about
the GStreamer framework is available on the GStreamer project site:
http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/.

.. rubric:: TI Provided Gstreamer Plugins
   :name: ti-provided-gstreamer-plugins

One benefit of using GStreamer as a multimedia framework is that the
core libraries already build and run on ARM Linux. Only a GStreamer
plugin is required to enable additional hardware features on TI's
embedded processors with both ARM and hardware accelerators for
multimedia. The TI GStreamer plugins provide elements for GStreamer
pipelines that enable the use of plug-and-play IVAHD codecs, certain
hardware-accelerated operations such as video frame resizing,
de-interlacing, and color space conversion, image processing offloaded
to DSP, and ARM based HEVC decoding. The TI GStreamer plugins provide
baseline support for eXpressDSPTM Digital Media (xDM1) plug-and-play
codecs. Multiple xDM versions are supported, making it easy to migrate
between codecs that conform to different versions of the xDM
specification.

Below is a list of TI GStreamer plugins provided in Processor SDK.

.. rubric:: Visual Representation of Typical GStreamer Pipelines
   :name: visual-representation-of-typical-gstreamer-pipelines

A typical GStreamer pipeline starts with one or more source elements,
uses zero or more filter elements, and ends in a sink or multiple sinks.
This section provides visual representation of two typical gstreamer
pipelines: 1) multimedia decoding and playout, and 2) video capture,
encoding, and network transmission.

.. rubric:: Decode Pipeline
   :name: decode-pipeline

The example pipeline shown in the figure below demonstrates the demuxing
and playback of a transport stream. The input is first read using the
source element, and then processed by gstreamer playbin2. Inside
playbin2, demuxer first demuxes the stream into its audio and video
stream components. The video stream is then queued and sent to TI ducati
gstreamer plugin for decoding. Finally, it is sent to a video sink to
display the decoded video on the screen. The audio stream is queued and
then decoded by ARM audio gstreamer plugin, and then reaches its
destination at the alsasink element to play the decoded audio.

processed by VPE, and then queued for video encoding. After that, it is
queued for video parsing, muxing. Finally, it is sent to network through
RTP payloader and udp sink.

.. rubric:: Running a gstreamer pipeline
   :name: running-a-gstreamer-pipeline

GStreamer v1.6 is supported in Processor SDK.

Gstreamer pipelines can also run from command line. In order to do so,
exit Weston by pressing Ctrl-Alt-Backspace from the keyboard which
connects to the EVM. Then, if the LCD screen stays in "Please wait...",
press Ctrl-Alt-F1 to go to the command line on LCD console. After that,
the command line can be used from serial console, SSH console, or LCD
console.

| One can run an audio video file using the gstreamer playbin from the
  console. Currently, the supported Audio/video sink is kmssink,
  waylandsink and alsassink.

::

    kmssink:
      target #  gst-launch-1.0 playbin uri=file:///<path_to_file> video-sink=kmssink audio-sink=alsasink

::

    waylandsink:
      1. refer Wayland/Weston to start the weston
      2. target #  gst-launch-1.0 playbin uri=file:///<path_to_file> video-sink=waylandsink audio-sink=alsasink

| 
| The following pipelines show how to use vpe for scaling and color
  space conversion.

::

      1. Decode-> Scale->Display
         target # gst-launch-1.0 -v filesrc location=example_h264.mp4 ! qtdemux ! h264parse ! \
     ducatih264dec ! vpe ! 'video/x-raw, format=(string)NV12, width=(int)720, height=(int)480' ! kmssink

::

      2. Color space conversion:
         target # gst-launch-1.0 -v videotestsrc ! 'video/x-raw, format=(string)YUY2, width= \
     (int)1280, height=(int)720' ! vpe ! 'video/x-raw, format=(string)NV12, width=(int)720, height=(int)480' \
     ! kmssink

::

    Note: 
      1. While using playbin for playing the stream, vpe plugin is automatically picked up. However vpe cannot be used with playbin for scaling.
    For utilizing scaling capabilities of vpe, using manual pipeline given above is recommended.
      2. Waylandsink and Kmssink uses the cropping metadata set on buffers and does not require vpe plugin for cropping

| 
| The following pipelines show how to use v4l2src and ducatimpeg4enc
  elements to capture video from VIP and encode captured video
  respectively.

::

    Capture and Display Fullscreen
      target #  gst-launch-1.0 v4l2src device=/dev/video1 num-buffers=1000 io-mode=4 ! 'video/x-raw, \
    format=(string)YUY2, width=(int)1280, height=(int)720' ! vpe num-input-buffers=8 ! queue ! kmssink

::

    Note:
     The following pipelines can also be used for NV12 capture-display usecase. 
     Dmabuf is allocated by v4l2src if io-mode=4 and by kmssink and imported by v4l2src if io-mode=5

::

    Note:
     The following pipelines can also be used for NV12 capture-display usecase. Dmabuf is allocated by v4l2src 
     if io-mode=4 and by waylandsink and imported by v4l2src if io-mode=5.
     Waylandsink supports both shm and drm. A new property use-drm is added to specify drm allocator based bufferpool to be used.
     When using ducati or vpe plugins, use-drm is set in caps as true.
     target # gst-launch-1.0 v4l2src device=/dev/video1 num-buffers=1000 io-mode=4 ! 'video/x-raw, \
    format=(string)NV12, width=(int)1280, height=(int)720' ! waylandsink use-drm=true

Below provides more gstreamer pipeline examples.

1. File to file video encoding pipeline:

::

    target #  gst-launch-1.0 filesrc location=waterfall-352-288-nv12-inp.yuv ! videoparse width=352 height=288 format=nv12 ! video/x-raw, width=352, height=288 ! ducatih264enc ! filesink location=waterfall-352-288-nv12-inp_gst.h264

The cap filter of "video/x-raw, width=352, height=288" is needed in this
pipeline to specify the width and height. Otherwise, variable width and
height are configured for the encoder and the encoded output can be
corrupted.

| 
| 2. ARM H265 (HEVC) decoding pipeline

::

    target #  gst-launch-1.0 filesrc location=<file>.265 ! 'video/x-raw, format=(string)NV12, framerate=(fraction)24/1, width=(int)1280, height=(int)720'  ! h265dec threads=2 !  vpe ! kmssink

3. DSP offloaded image processing pipeline

::

    target #  gst-launch-1.0 filesrc location=<file>.265 ! 'video/x-raw, format=(string)NV12, framerate=(fraction)24/1, width=(int)1280, height=(int)720'  ! h265dec threads=1 ! videoconvert ! dsp66videokernel kerneltype=1 filtersize=9 lum-only=1 ! videoconvert ! vpe ! 'video/x-raw, format=(string)NV12, width=(int)640, height=(int)480' ! kmssink

This pipeline decodes an H265 clip on ARM A15, offloads the image
processing task (Sobel 3x3 kernel) to DSP, and the processed clip is
then re-sized and displayed.

Processor SDK provides reference implementation of multiple image
processing kernels, for which the pipeline can be configured as shown in
the table below.

.. rubric:: DSP C66x Gstreamer Plugin Internals
   :name: dsp-c66x-gstreamer-plugin-internals

| TI's Processor SDK Linux supplies ARM based GStreamer plugin that
  abstracts C66x DSP offload. The primary goal of this DSP GStreamer
  plugin is to demonstrate how C66x can be used in GStreamer framework,
  in combination with other GStreamer plugins. The plugin, under the
  hood, uses OpenCL to dispatch to the C66x cores. This plugin provides
  sample DSP kernels and can be used as a reference to develop user's
  own DSP kernels.

.. rubric:: Overview of Existing Source Code
   :name: overview-of-existing-source-code

Source code of the DSP plugin can be found from
http://git.ti.com/processor-sdk/gst-plugin-dsp66.

As shown in the figure below, the GST plugin code (gstdsp66\*.c and
gstdsp66\*.h files) is directly under the ./src folder. It is
implemented in C following GST framework requirements, and therefore it
is compatible with the gstreamer version used in Processor-SDK-Linux.

Dispatch of work load to DSP is done via call to functions in
independent shared objects, which are implemented in OpenCL code
organized under the kernels folder. The kernels folder currently has a
sub-folder of oclconv, which provides sample DSP kernels for image
processing. As long as the APIs between the GST plugin code (in ./src
folder) and OpenCL code (in ./src/kernels/oclconv folder) are the same,
this shared object can be compiled and installed separately. This
approach allows easier modification, implementation and maintenance once
the APIs are fixed.

   <div class="floatnone">

.. Image:: ../images/GST-dsp66-src.png

.. raw:: html

   </div>

.. raw:: html

   </div>

The image processing functions in oclconv are implemented via calls to
DSP optimized imglib and vlib library functions, or implemented in
OpenCL C.

-  Kernels implemented with OpenCL C: Median2x2
-  Kernels implemented with imglib function calls from OpenCL C:
   Median3x3, Sobel3x3, Conv5x5
-  Kernels implemented with vlib function calls from OpenCL C: Canny

.. rubric:: Adding Custom DSP Kernels
   :name: adding-custom-dsp-kernels

| Using the existing oclconv as the template, more folders can be added
  under ./src/kernels folder to create shared libraries with additional
  wrappers (for functions invoked from GST plugin context) and OCL (host
  side and DSP) kernels. Makefile in ./src/kernels folder will attempt
  make in all sub-folders. Each sub-folder will provide independent
  shared library object that can be invoked from gstdsp66 context (e.g.,
  function calls in ./src/gstdsp66videokernel.c file). Individual shared
  object libraries can be independently recompiled and updated in the
  target file system.

.. rubric:: Modifying the Existing Plugin
   :name: modifying-the-existing-plugin

The DSP plugin also allows easy modifications and additions, and below
are some examples.

Currently the DSP plugin provides five sample image process operations:
1) Median2x2; 2) Median3x3; 3) Sobel3x3; 4) Conv5x5; and 5) Canny. Users
can modify the source code to add more image processing operations as
needed.

Currently the DSP plugin provides properties as below. More properties
can be added so that they can be passed from gst-launcher.

-  kerneltype: select the kernel type
-  filtersize: the size of the filter, choose from (5,9,25)
-  lum-only: true for applying the filter on luminance only, false for
   applying on all three planes.
-  arbkernel: provide a way to specify the name of the kernel invoked
   via OpenCL.

| Details of a specific image processing kernel can also be modified,
  e.g., the coefficients for Conv5x5 kernel, which are defined in
  kernels/oclconv/conv.cl::kernel void Conv5x5() function.

.. rubric:: Rebuilding and Installing the Plugin
   :name: rebuilding-and-installing-the-plugin

After modifications/additions are made for the DSP plugin source code,
the plugin needs to be rebuilt, and this can be done from the Yocto
build.

First, please refer to `Processor SDK Building The
SDK <http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Processor_SDK_Building_The_SDK>`__
to set up the build environment and bitbake the original recipe for
gstreamer1.0-plugins-dsp66, i.e.,

``MACHINE=am57xx-evm bitbake gstreamer1.0-plugins-dsp66``

After the bitbake command above is successfully done,
./build/arago-tmp-external-linaro-toolchain/work/cortexa15hf-vfp-neon-linux-gnueabi/gstreamer1.0-plugins-dsp66/git-r<\*>
will be created with the original source code under the git sub-folder.
Copy the modified and/or the newly added files to the git sub-folder,
and rebuild the plugin referring to `Rebuild
Recipe <http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Processor_SDK_Building_The_SDK#Forced_Re-compilation>`__.

Last, install the rebuilt plugin on target filesystem referring to
`Install
Package <http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Processor_SDK_Building_The_SDK#Installing_Package>`__.
After the installation, the following files will be updated and/or
added. Gstreamer framework includes seamless detection and registration
of the new plugin.

-  */usr/lib/gstreamer-1.0/libgstdsp66.so*
-  */usr/lib/liboclconv.so*
-  *[optional] any additional shared library (as described in previous
   section), should be placed in /usr/lib*

.. rubric:: Firmware Loading and Unloading
   :name: firmware-loading-and-unloading

The table below shows the remote cores and their corresponding
definitions in the kernel dtsi files
(``[ti-processor-sdk-linux-am57xx-evm-[ver]]/board-support/linux-[ver]/arch/arm/boot/dts/dra7.dtsi, and dra74x.dtsi``),
as well as the argument to be used in the loading/unloading commands.

+-------------------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| **Remote Core**   | **Definition in dtsi file**   | **Argument in loading/unloading**   |
+-------------------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| IPU1              | ipu@58820000                  | 58820000.ipu                        |
+-------------------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| IPU2              | ipu@55020000                  | 55020000.ipu                        |
+-------------------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| DSP1              | dsp@40800000                  | 40800000.dsp                        |
+-------------------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| DSP2              | dsp@41000000                  | 41000000.dsp                        |
+-------------------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------+

For example, the argument of ``55020000.ipu`` corresponds to IPU2 as can
be seen from ``dra7.dtsi``.

::

       ipu2: ipu@55020000 {
            compatible = "ti,dra7-rproc-ipu";

In the sections below, ``55020000.ipu`` will be used as the example. For
a specific use case, please select the corresponding argument which is
applicable.

.. rubric:: Unloading and loading remotecores at runtime
   :name: unloading-and-loading-remotecores-at-runtime

It is possible to unload and reload a remotecore at runtime from Linux
using the ``sysfs`` interface.

::

    target $ cd /sys/bus/platform/drivers/omap-rproc/ 
    target $ echo 55020000.ipu > unbind 
    target $ echo 55020000.ipu > bind

The ``echo 55020000.ipu > unbind`` command tears down the communication
channels between the A15 and the remotecore and unloads the remotecore.
Any application level shutdown that needs to be performed needs to be
handled by the system integrator.

The ``echo 55020000.ipu > bind`` loads the appropriate firmware binary
onto the remotecore.

.. rubric:: Changing the remotecore binary at runtime
   :name: changing-the-remotecore-binary-at-runtime

To change the remotecore binary at runtime

#. Unload the remotecore using ``unbind``.
#. Change the remotecore binary in the firmware folder. Default location
   is ``/lib/firmware`` on the target filesystem.
#. Load the remotecore using ``bind``.

::

    target $ cd /sys/bus/platform/drivers/omap-rproc/
    target $ echo 55020000.ipu > unbind
    target $ cp /home/root/new-binary.xem4 /lib/firmware/dra7-ipu2-fw.xem4
    target $ echo 55020000.ipu > bind

If it is desirable to avoid overwriting the existing remote binaries,
the method of symbolic links can be used instead of direct copy. For
example, Processor SDK provides two types of DSP remotecore binaries:
one for DSPDCE (dra7-dsp1-fw.xe66.dspdce-fw) and another one for OpenCL
(dra7-dsp1-fw.xe66.opencl-monitor). dra7-dsp1-fw.xe66 is created as a
symbolic link by default pointing to the OpenCL binary. When it is
needed to switch to DSPDCE, the symbolic link of dra7-dsp1-fw.xe66 can
be updated pointing to dra7-dsp1-fw.xe66.dspdce-fw.

::

    target $ cd /sys/bus/platform/drivers/omap-rproc/
    target $ echo 40800000.dsp > unbind
    target $ rm /lib/firmware/dra7-dsp1-fw.xe66
    target $ ln -s /lib/firmware/dra7-dsp1-fw.xe66.dspdce-fw /lib/firmware/dra7-dsp1-fw.xe66
    target $ echo 40800000.dsp > bind

After the switch, copycodectest application can be run to verify that
DSPDCE firmware is loaded. This application fills the input buffer with
a number entered as the argument and after process the output buffer is
tested for the same pattern.

usage: copycodectest pattern.

Example:

::

     target # copycodectest 123

Sample console output:

::

      root@am57xx-evm:~# copycodectest 123
      0x22070: Opening Engine..
      Created dsp_universalCopy
      Fill input buffer with pattern 123
      Verifing the UniversalCopy algorithm
      copycodectest executed successfully

.. rubric:: Loading firmware during initial boot without using udev
   :name: loading-firmware-during-initial-boot-without-using-udev

During the default boot, firmware is supplied to the kernel by ``udev``.
Starting the ``udev`` service on boot causes a few seconds increase in
boot time. In cases where a quick boot is required, the user may not
start the ``udev`` service in boot. In such cases, firmware can be
supplied to the kernel using the sysfs interface. An example script is
shown below.

::

    FW_NAMES="dra7-dsp1-fw.xe66 dra7-dsp2-fw.xe66 dra7-ipu1-fw.xem4 dra7-ipu2-fw.xem4"
    for FW in $FW_NAMES ; do
        echo 1 > /sys/class/firmware/$FW/loading
        cat /lib/firmware/$FW > /sys/class/firmware/$FW/data
        echo 0 > /sys/class/firmware/$FW/loading
    done
