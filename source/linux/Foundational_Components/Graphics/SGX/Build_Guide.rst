SGX Build Guide
###############

The graphics stack on SGX has been frozen. The last major change occured in
release 09.01. This will capture the build process and some of the caviots of
this legacy driver.

This driver has been reworked as part of the kernel 6.1 support effort to mimic
the build and structure of rogue. The stack consists of 3 main components with
varying classifications:

   - The kernel module (KM) (Open Source, but out-of-tree)
   - The GLES 2.0 implementation (UM) (Closed Source, binary release)
   - The mesa shim (Open Source, but out-of-tree)

All 3 of these components are required for GLES support.

*****************
SGX Kernel Module
*****************

The kernel module is responsible for:

   - Memory and power management
   - Monitoring device state
   - Orchestrating hardware recoveries
   - Creating an interface for the userspace server

The source for the component is available at:

   https://git.ti.com/cgit/graphics/omap5-sgx-ddk-linux

Building the SGX Kernel Module
==============================

The latest branch contains the most bugfixes and has been adapted for the widest
general compatibility in modern applications. This is
``1.17.4948957/mesa/k6.1``, and despite being tagged for kernel 6.1 it is also
interoperable with kernel 6.6.

The :file:`INSTALL` file gives a brief overview of how to build and install the
module. This gives you the common variables, but it does leave out some of the
more important ones for the build. The following variables are key and *must*
match with the values used in the UM release:

   - ``BUILD`` -- Options: ``release`` or ``debug``
   - ``PVR_BUILD_DIR`` -- Options: ``<platform>_linux``, for example ``ti572x_linux``
   - ``WINDOW_SYSTEM`` -- Options: ``lws-generic``, ``xorg``, ``wayland``, ...

These variables must be set for the build. To check for updated build variables
please see the ``EXTRA_OEMAKE`` variable in the `ti-sgx-ddk-km recipe in
meta-ti`_. This will always contain the latest required variables to compile the
driver.

.. _ti-sgx-ddk-km recipe in meta-ti: https://git.ti.com/cgit/arago-project/meta-ti/tree/meta-ti-bsp/recipes-bsp/powervr-drivers/ti-sgx-ddk-km_1.17.4948957.bb

As previously mentioned these build options must match with the corresponding UM
build options. Currently we only release binaries with ``BUILD=release`` and
``WINDOW_SYSTEM=lws-generic``. The UM section will go previous exceptions
to this.

************************
SGX Userspace Components
************************

The proprietary userspace components are required for all interactions with the
GPU. It contains the firmware, GLES implementation, and the primary control
server. Unlike rogue, the firmware is packaged as part of the control sever
library.

The binary release for this component is available at:

   https://git.ti.com/cgit/graphics/omap5-sgx-ddk-um-linux

Installing the SGX Userspace Components
=======================================

The repository contains binaries for each platform in release specific branches.
The newest release, which matches with the above mentioned kernel module branch
is ``1.17.4948957/mesa/glibc-2.35``. This branch deviates from the existing
naming pattern to indicate that unlike previous releases it required a new
version of mesa and was linked against glibc-2.35.

In the repository the following structure can be seen:

.. code-block:: text

   .
   ├── LICENSE
   ├── Makefile
   ├── README.md
   └── targetfs
       ├── common
       │   ├── 50-pvrsrvctl.rules.template
       │   ├── etc
       │   └── pvrsrvctl.service.template
       ├── ti335x_linux
       │   └── lws-generic
       ├── ti343x_linux
       │   └── lws-generic
       ├── ti437x_linux
       │   └── lws-generic

       ├── ti572x_linux
       │   └── lws-generic
       └── ti654x_linux
           └── lws-generic

Under the :file:`targetfs` directory there is a subdirectory for each
``PVR_BUILD_DIR`` build variable. Under that directory is a subdirectory
corresponding to the ``WINDOW_SYSTEM`` build variable. Finally, under that
directory is a subdirectory corresponding to the ``BUILD`` build variable.

This is reflected in the :file:`Makefile` as:

.. code-block:: Makefile

   PRODUCTDIR := ./targetfs/${TARGET_PRODUCT}/${WINDOW_SYSTEM}/${BUILD}

The :file:`Makefile` simply unpacks this directory structure and installs the
corresponding files into ``DESTDIR`` in the install step. Do not worry about the
clean step, as this is used for development.

Unlike rogue, there is an additional :file:`common` directory that contains
startup script templates. These templates are automatically modified by the
:file:`Makefile` as part of the install step.

These are not strictly required, but you will need to manually start the device
with :command:`pvrsrvctl` if you choose not to use these templates. Please note
that this binary is, and always has been brittle. It likely will not realize
what kernel you are running so you should specify ``--no-module`` when
interacting with it.

*******************
SGX Mesa Components
*******************

Mesa, at this point in time, is a collection of GFX tools and utilities for
setting up and interacting with rendering contexts. It contains everything from
a DRI "megadriver" to full GLES/GL implementations. If you're interested in
learning GFX under Linux it's worth familiarizing yourself with everything else
it provides.

For us, the important part is that DRI "megadriver." This is the mechanism used
to determine what GLES / GL implementation is picked when you bind one of the
previously mentioned API to a EGL context. This is also where things get tricky.

Historically there has been some issues with embedded GFX because, unlike your
standard PC GPU, we tend to mix and match actual Graphics Processing Units and
Display Controllers. The megadriver uses the display device name to coordinate
between API implementations. As such, we need a shim to act as a DRI driver and
coordinate the link with the SGX GLES implementation.

This shim, currently, is provided in the form of a Gallium Frontend. This is the
main reason for the fork and the 60 odd patches we carry at the following repo:

   https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/StaticRocket/mesa

There are also other nice-to-have features there such as additional pixel
formats, minor fixups, and a few performance tweaks IMG have picked up over the
years, but the main reason we need it is for that shim.

Building the SGX Mesa Components
================================

We recommend following the `Mesa build guide`_ for general options. Right now
the mesa components use a standard interface that allows you to pick any
``powervr/*`` branch equal to or greater than ``22.3.5``.

The only necessary build options are:

   - ``-Dgallium-drivers=sgx`` -- This is a comma separated list, just make sure
     sgx is present in it.

   - ``-Dgallium-sgx-alias=`` -- This should match the display controller you
     want to bind to. This can either be ``tilcdc``, ``tidss``, or ``omapdrm``
     depending on the device.

This will produce 3 important files relevant to the shim mechanism we discussed
earlier:

   - :file:`sgx_dri.so` -- Main DRI interface

   - :file:`pvr_dri.so` -- GPU interface that points back to :file:`sgx_dri.so`.
     This is required in the case an application attempts to interact with the
     GPU directly because the DRI device is still registered with the name
     ``pvr``.

   - :file:`<display>_dri.so` -- Display controller interface that points back
     at :file:`sgx_dri.so`. Will be named after the value specified with
     ``-Dgallium-sgx-alias``.

*******************
Using the SGX Stack
*******************

Assuming you're using the SDK or you've built and installed the above correctly,
you should see a message similar to the following in :command:`dmesg` after the
kernel module is loaded:

.. code-block:: dmesg

   [   17.344567] [drm] Initialized pvr 1.17.4948957 20110701 for 56000000.gpu on minor 1

If the module loads but does not detect the device, make sure your device tree
has defined the node properly, corresponding to one of the values of
``powervr_id_table`` in the :file:`services4/srvkm/env/linux/module.c`.

Upon starting the userspace daemon you should see the following message:

.. code-block:: dmesg

   [   29.277564] PVR_K: UM DDK-(4948957) and KM DDK-(4948957) match. [ OK ]

You should now be able to issue a simple test. We recommend
:command:`glmark2-es2-drm`. You should see the following indicating you are
using the correct driver:

.. code-block:: console

   root@am335x-evm:~# glmark2-es2-drm 
   MESA: info: Loaded libpvr_dri_support.so
   =======================================================
       glmark2 2021.12

       OpenGL Information

       GL_VERSION:    OpenGL ES 2.0 build 1.17@4948957

The ``GL_VENDOR`` should report ``Imagination Technologies`` with the renderer
corresponding to the graphics processor in that device.
