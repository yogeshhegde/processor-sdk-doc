GTK+ Graphics Framework
#######################

GTK+, or the GIMP Toolkit, is a multi-platform toolkit for creating graphical
user interfaces.  Offering a complete set of widgets, GTK+ is suitable for
projects ranging from small one-off tools to complete application suites.

Please refer to `<https://www.gtk.org/>`_ for additional details on GTK+.

The PSDK target file system includes the pre-built GTK+ libraries under
:file:`/usr/lib` for GTK+3 over Wayland support. There is also a comprehensive
GTK+3 demo application (``gtk3-demo``) under :file:`/usr/bin` to demonstrate GTK+3
APIs and their usages.

GTK+ will attempt to interact with a windowing system on startup. If one is not
running, or it fails to connect to one for any reason, you will see the
following error:

.. code-block:: text

   (<application-name>:<pid>): Gtk-WARNING **: 21:21:27.361: cannot open display: <display>

If no display value is returned, then you are more than likely missing the
``WAYLAND_DISPLAY`` environment variable. Check the :doc:`Weston`
section for more information.
