Build Guide
###########

The graphics stack on rogue has fluctuated a little over the years as we've
adjusted for binary longevity in the proprietary stack. This will attempt to go
over some of the discrepancies between releases and how you can build the
releases stand alone.

*****************
Proprietary Stack
*****************

The proprietary stack has been our default offering for all releases so far. It
consists of 3 main components with varying classifications:

   - The kernel module (KM) (Open Source, but out-of-tree)
   - The GLES / Vulkan / OpenCL implementation (UM) (Closed Source, binary release)
   - The mesa shim (Open Source, but out-of-tree)

All 3 of these components are required for GLES and Vulkan support. Exceptions
will be covered in :ref:`rogue-proprietary-mesa-components`.

Proprietary Kernel Module
=========================

The kernel module is required for:

   - Memory and power management
   - Loading firmware
   - Monitoring device state
   - Orchestrating hardware recoveries
   - Creating an interface for the userspace server

The source for the component is available at:

   https://git.ti.com/cgit/graphics/ti-img-rogue-driver/

.. _rogue-building-the-proprietary-kernel-module:

Building the Proprietary Kernel Module
--------------------------------------

Pick a branch that corresponds to your particular kernel. Keep note of the name.
The UM component must match this release.

The :file:`INSTALL` file gives a brief overview of how to build and install the
module. This gives you the common variables, but it does leave out some of the
more important ones for the build. The following variables are key and *must*
match with the values used in the UM release:

   - ``BUILD`` -- Options: ``release`` or ``debug``
   - ``PVR_BUILD_DIR`` -- Options: ``<platform>_linux``, for example ``am62_linux``
   - ``WINDOW_SYSTEM`` -- Options: ``lws-generic``, ``xorg``, ``wayland``, ...

These variables must be set for the build. To check for updated build variables
please see the ``EXTRA_OEMAKE`` variable in the `ti-img-rogue-driver recipe in
meta-ti`_. This will always contain the latest required variables to compile the
driver.

.. _ti-img-rogue-driver recipe in meta-ti: https://git.ti.com/cgit/arago-project/meta-ti/tree/meta-ti-bsp/recipes-bsp/powervr-drivers/ti-img-rogue-driver_24.1.6554834.bb?h=10.01.09

As previously mentioned these build options must match with the corresponding UM
build options. Currently we only release binaries with ``BUILD=release`` and
``WINDOW_SYSTEM=lws-generic``. The UM section will go previous exceptions
to this.


Proprietary Userspace Components
================================

The proprietary userspace components are required for all interactions with the
GPU. It contains the actual firmware binaries, GLES / Vulkan / OpenCL
implementation, and the primary control server.

The binary release for this component is available at:

   https://git.ti.com/cgit/graphics/ti-img-rogue-umlibs/

Installing the Proprietary Userspace Components
-----------------------------------------------

The repository contains binaries for each platform in release specific branches.
Newer releases will match 1:1 with the kernel module branch name you would have
picked in the :ref:`rogue-building-the-proprietary-kernel-module` stage.

In the repository the following structure can be seen:

.. code-block:: text

   .
   ├── LICENSE
   ├── Makefile
   ├── README
   └── targetfs
       ├── am62_linux
       │   └── lws-generic
       │       └── release
       ├── am62p_linux
       │   └── lws-generic
       │       └── release
       ├── j721e_linux
       │   └── lws-generic
       │       └── release
       ├── j721s2_linux
       │   └── lws-generic
       │       └── release
       ├── j722s_linux
       │   └── lws-generic
       │       └── release
       └── j784s4_linux
           └── lws-generic
               └── release

Under the :file:`targetfs` directory there is a subdirectory for each
``PVR_BUILD_DIR`` build variable. Under that directory is a subdirectory
corresponding to the ``WINDOW_SYSTEM`` build variable. Finally, under that
directory is a subdirectory corresponding to the ``BUILD`` build variable.

This is reflected in the :file:`Makefile` as:

.. code-block:: Makefile

   SRCDIR = ./targetfs/${TARGET_PRODUCT}/${WINDOW_SYSTEM}/${BUILD}

The :file:`Makefile` simply unpacks this directory structure and installs the
corresponding files into ``DESTDIR`` in the install step. Do not worry about the
clean step, as this is used for development.

.. _rogue-proprietary-mesa-components:

Proprietary Mesa Components
===========================

Mesa, at this point in time, is a collection of GFX tools and utilities for
setting up and interacting with rendering contexts. It contains everything from
a DRI "megadriver" to full GLES/GL implementations. If you're interested in
learning GFX under Linux it's worth familiarizing yourself with everything else
it provides.

For us, the important part is that DRI megadriver. This is the mechanism used to
determine what GLES / GL implementation is picked when you bind one of the
previously mentioned API to a EGL context. This is also where things get tricky.

Historically there has been some issues with embedded GFX because, unlike your
standard PC GPU, we tend to mix and match actual Graphics Processing Units and
Display Controllers. The megadriver uses the display device name to coordinate
between API implementations. As such, we need a shim to act as a ``tidss``
DRI driver and coordinate the link with the PVR GLES implementation.

This shim, currently, is provided in the form of a Gallium Frontend. This is the
main reason for the fork and the 60 odd patches we carry at the following repo:

   https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/StaticRocket/mesa

There are also other nice-to-have features there such as additional pixel
formats, minor fixups, and a few performance tweaks IMG have picked up over the
years, but the main reason we need it is for that shim.

Building the Proprietary Mesa Components
----------------------------------------

We recommend following the `Mesa build guide`_ for general options. Right now
the mesa components use a standard interface that allows you to pick any
``powervr/*`` branch you desire.

.. note::

   Releases prior to 1.18 did not use this standard interface. Instead all
   relevant mesa components for those releases are bundled with the UM binaries.

The only necessary build options are:

   - ``-Dgallium-drivers=pvr`` -- This is a comma separated list, just make sure
     pvr is present in it.

   - ``-Dgallium-pvr-alias=tidss`` -- This should match the display controller
     you want to bind to. For all K3 devices this is ``tidss``.

   - ``-Dvulkan-drivers=pvr`` -- If using Vulkan

This will produce 2 important files relevant to the shim mechanism we discussed
earlier:

   - :file:`pvr_dri.so` -- Main DRI interface

   - :file:`tidss_dri.so` -- Display controller interface that points back at
     :file:`pvr_dri.so`. Will be named after the value specified with
     ``-Dgallium-pvr-alias``.

Using the Proprietary Stack
===========================

Assuming you're using the SDK or you've built and installed the above correctly,
you should see a message similar to the following in :command:`dmesg` after the
kernel module is loaded:

.. code-block:: dmesg

   [    7.716820] pvrsrvkm: loading out-of-tree module taints kernel.
   [    7.796345] PVR_K:  172: Device: 4e20000000.gpu
   [    7.859807] PVR_K:  172: Read BVNC 36.53.104.796 from HW device registers
   [    7.870809] PVR_K:  172: RGX Device registered BVNC 36.53.104.796 with 1 core in the system
   [    7.881015] [drm] Initialized pvr 24.1.6554834 20170530 for 4e20000000.gpu on minor 0

The BVNC should correspond with the BVNC set in
:file:`build/linux/{PVR_BUILD_DIR}/Makefile` in the kernel module repository. If
the module loads but does not detect the device, make sure your device tree has
defined the node properly, corresponding to the value of `SYS_RGX_OF_COMPATIBLE`
in the :file:`services/system/rogue/{platform}/sysinfo.h`.

You should now be able to issue a simple test. The UM repository provides the
:command:`rgx_compute_test` as a simple test that does not depend on the display
or mesa components. You should see the following reported by the kernel module
upon launching that test:

.. code-block:: dmesg

   [  460.674895] PVR_K:  332: RGX Firmware image 'rgx.fw.36.53.104.796' loaded
   [  460.694849] PVR_K:  332: Shader binary image 'rgx.sh.36.53.104.796' loaded

*****************
Open Source Stack
*****************

The open source driver is currently available for the AXE-1-16M core, but it
should be noted that performance is not up to par with the proprietary driver at
the moment. Performance improvements are on the table, but core enablement is
the main priority right now.

It currently offers experimental Vulkan 1.0 support. In the future it will
provide at least GL 2.1 via `Zink <https://docs.mesa3d.org/drivers/zink.html>`_.
Please note that Zink support for this driver is not mainline, and it is still
experimental. If you want to follow development check out the `Imagination mesa
fork <https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/imagination/mesa>`_

Open Source Kernel Module
=========================

This is provided in the upstream `linux
<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git>`_ repo as
of version 6.8. It has been enabled in the arm64 defconfig as a module since
this release as well.

Open Source Firmware
====================

Firmware is provided with `linux-firmware
<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git>`_
as of tag 20231211.

.. note::

   This a binary, and the firmware itself is still closed source right now, but
   this is not the same firmware as the proprietary driver.

Open Source Mesa Components
===========================

The open source stack dramatically reduces the number of moving pieces by
combining the Vulkan implementation with Mesa. This Vulkan implementation is
still marked as experimental, though. Once again, we recommend following the
`Mesa build guide`_ for general options.

The only necessary build options are:

   - ``-Dvulkan-drivers=imagination-experimental`` -- Enable the experimental
     AXE Vulkan driver

   - ``-Dimagination-srv=true`` -- Enable the open control server

   - ``-Dgallium-drivers=zink`` -- Enable GL 2.1 through Zink

Using the Open Source Stack
===========================

After collecting the above artifacts you should be able to see the following
message in :command:`dmesg`:

.. code-block:: dmesg

   [    8.489877] powervr fd00000.gpu: [drm] loaded firmware powervr/rogue_33.15.11.3_v1.fw
   [    8.489916] powervr fd00000.gpu: [drm] FW version v1.0 (build 6503725 OS)
   [    8.543073] [drm] Initialized powervr 1.0.0 for fd00000.gpu on minor 1

Once again, if the module is loaded but you do not see the device being
registered make sure the device tree node matches the binding provided in the
upstream kernel.

At this point you should be able to run a simple test. The tool
:command:`vulkaninfo` from the package ``vulkan-tools`` is useful for printing
information about available Vulkan implementations.

The following will print a brief summary:

.. code-block::

   root@am62xx-evm:~# PVR_I_WANT_A_BROKEN_VULKAN_DRIVER=1 vulkaninfo --summary
