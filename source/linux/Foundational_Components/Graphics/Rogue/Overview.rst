.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_gpu_ip in ('Rogue_8XE')

   |__PART_FAMILY_DEVICE_NAMES__| device is enabled with 3D graphics
   accelerator based on the Rogue 8XE series from Imagination Technologies Inc.
   It enables the support of 3D graphics rendering using OpenGL\ |reg| ES
   API's. The OpenGL\ |reg| ES API's up to and including version 3.2 with
   render surfaces upto 4k and input textures upto 8k sizes are supported by
   the hardware. It also supports Vulkan |reg| up to API version 1.2.

   The following extensions are supported:

   |__PART_FAMILY_DEVICE_NAMES__| device is enabled with 3D graphics
   accelerator based on the B-Series BXS-4-64 from Imagination Technologies
   Inc. It enables the support of 3D graphics rendering using OpenGL\ |reg| ES
   API's. The OpenGL\ |reg| ES API's up to and including version 3.2 with
   render surfaces upto 4k and input textures upto 8k sizes are supported by
   the hardware. It also supports Vulkan |reg| up to API version 1.2.

   The following extensions are supported:

For more information about the supported OpenGL\ |reg| ES and EGL\ |reg|
extensions see:

   .. note::

      OpenCL\ |reg| libraries are currently provided without support at
      `<https://git.ti.com>`_

These devices do not utilize static memory carveouts. The only reservations
made in device tree are for control registers. Memory is instead dynamically
allocated at runtime depending on the task and will scale accordingly.
Buffers are allocated from CMA and other runtime memory allocations are made
from standard pages. See the kernel module memory management subsystem for
more information.

Other features of the Rogue series of GPUs include bilinear and trilinear filtering.

Support for Ericsson Texture Compression (ETC1 and ETC2) on input textures.
For an example toolkit to interact with these texture compression mechanisms,
see the Khronos `KTX-Software
<https://github.com/KhronosGroup/KTX-Software>`_ project.

Support for OS controlled Active Power Management, enabled by default.

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_gpu_ip in ('Rogue_AXE')

   Support for up to 2Kx2K render surfaces.

   Support for OS suspend and resume functions. See
   :doc:`/linux/How_to_Guides/Target/How_to_suspend_to_ram_on_AM62x` for more
   info.

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_gpu_ip in ('Rogue_BXS', 'Rogue_8XE')

Software Architecture
=====================

The picture below shows the software architecture of Graphics in
|__SDK_FULL_NAME__|.

   :align: center

   PSDK Linux Rogue Graphics Software Stack

Please note that RGX-KM in this context refers to the pvrsrvkm kernel module,
which is currently provided at:

   - `<https://git.ti.com/cgit/graphics/ti-img-rogue-driver>`_

This is included by default in the SDK. The kernel module is located at:

.. code-block:: console

   # /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/extra/pvrsrvkm.ko

Graphics Demos
==============

Along with the graphics driver and userspace libraries, the SDK also includes
example applications. Some of the demos are based on the IMG
Native_SDK examples.

The following 3D Graphics demos are available. The table below provides a
list of these demos, with a brief description.
