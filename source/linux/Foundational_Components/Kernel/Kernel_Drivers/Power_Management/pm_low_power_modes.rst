Low Power Modes
###############

********
Overview
********

The following sections describe a high-level description of the different low power modes of the
device. If your application requires inactive power management, you must determine which
low power mode described below satisfies your requirements. Each mode must be evaluated
based on power consumption and latency (the time it takes to wakeup to Active mode) requirements. Specific
values are detailed in the device-specific data sheet. As part of this SDK offering,
Texas Instruments has added support for the following low power modes:

#. Deep Sleep
#. MCU Only
#. Partial I/O


**********
Deep Sleep
**********

Deep Sleep AKA Suspend-to-RAM is a low-power mode that allows an embedded device
to retain its state in RAM while the processor is turned off.
This can save a significant amount of power, especially in devices that are
battery-powered.

The benefits of using deep sleep in embedded devices:

#. Faster wake-up: devices can wake up from this low-power state much faster than
   a complete power cycle.
#. Better efficiency: deep sleep can help to improve the efficiency of embedded devices by
   reducing the amount of time that the processor is idle. This is because the processor can
   be kept in a low-power state when it is not needed.

In order to enter deep sleep, use the following command:

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_part_variant in ('AM62X')

This partially indicates that linux has finished it's deep sleep sequence.
For further confirmation, one can take a look at the PMIC_LPM_EN pin on the EVM
(after programming the PMCTRL_SYS register (0x43018080) to 0x15). Here, if the pin is 3.3V when active and
0V when in deep sleep.

Refer to the :ref:`Wakeup Sources<pm_wakeup_sources>` section for information on how to wakeup the device from
Deep Sleep mode using one of the supported wakeup sources.


********
MCU Only
********

.. _pm_mcu_only:

Similar to Deep Sleep, with the major distinction being that the MCU core is kept alive to run applications.
The benefits of using MCU Only mode:

#. Low power consumption: MCU Only mode can save a significant amount of power, especially in battery-powered
   devices. This is because The rest of the SoC status is the same as Deep Sleep and DDR is in self-refresh.
#. Run background tasks: This mode can be used to run background tasks that do not require the full power of the system.
   For example, you could use the firmware on the MCU core to run a watchdog timer, a sensor polling loop,
   or a network communication task.
#. Respond to interrupts: This allows the system to still respond to external events, while it is in a low-power state.

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_part_variant in ('AM62X')

   To enter MCU Only mode, enable MCU M4 core as a wakeup source in linux:

   .. code-block:: console

      root@am62xx-evm:~# echo enabled > /sys/bus/platform/devices/5000000.m4fss/power/wakeup

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_part_variant in ('AM62AX', 'AM62PX')

   To enter MCU Only mode, enable MCU R5 core as a wakeup source in linux:

   .. code-block:: console

      root@<machine>:~# echo enabled > /sys/bus/platform/devices/79000000.r5f/power/wakeup

Now, the SoC can be suspended using the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    root@<machine>:~# rtcwake -s 5 -m mem

    [   46.032262] PM: suspend exit

Once the SoC enters MCU Only mode, the following log should be printed
on the MCU UART (in most cases it will be /dev/ttyUSB3)

.. code-block:: text

    [IPC RPMSG ECHO] Next MCU mode is 1
    [IPC RPMSG ECHO] Suspend request to MCU-only mode received
    [IPC RPMSG ECHO] Press a sinlge key on this terminal to resume the kernel from MCU only mode

Refer to the :ref:`Wakeup Sources<pm_wakeup_sources>` section for information on how to wakeup the device from
MCU Only mode using one of the supported wakeup sources.


***********
Partial I/O
***********

In Partial I/O, only the I/O pins and a small digital logic in the CANUART I/O
Bank are active, while the rest of the SoC is turned off. The user can
use the I/O pins to aggregate multiple I/O wakeup events and toggle
PMIC_LPM_EN pin to enable PMIC or discrete power solution when an I/O
wakeup event is triggered.

.. note::

   The system looses nearly all its state as DDR is also turned-off.
   Partial I/O is comparable with a Linux poweroff state.

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_part_variant in ('AM62X')

   .. important::

      Only AM62 LP-SK EVM supports Partial I/O mode.

The reference implementation in this SDK implements Partial I/O as a
poweroff state. On poweroff, Linux ti_sci driver checks the potential
Partial I/O wakeup sources for being enabled. If one of the wakeup
sources is found to be enabled, Partial I/O is entered instead of poweroff.

The following wakeup sources have been configured for Partial I/O:
mcu_uart0, mcu_mcan0, and mcu_mcan1. Partial I/O mode can only be tested
when `k3-am62x-sk-lpm-wkup-sources.dtso <https://git.ti.com/cgit/ti-linux-kernel/ti-linux-kernel/tree/arch/arm64/boot/dts/ti/k3-am62x-sk-lpm-wkup-sources.dtso?h=10.00.07>`__
overlay is loaded. Please refer to :ref:`How to enable DT overlays<howto_dt_overlays>` for more details.

After Linux boots, the MCAN wakeup for Partial I/O is enabled using the
wake on PHY activity option of ethtool. For example, the following
command enables mcu_mcan0 wakeup:

.. code-block:: console

   root@<machine>:~# ethtool -s mcu_mcan0 wol p

.. rubric:: To enable mcu_mcan1 wakeup:

.. code-block:: console

   root@<machine>:~# ethtool -s mcu_mcan1 wol p

.. rubric:: To enable UART wakeup:

.. code-block:: console

   root@<machine>:~# echo enabled > /sys/class/tty/ttyS0/device/power/wakeup

.. note::

   UART wakeup from Partial I/O is currently being debugged on the EVM.

With at least one of the wakeup sources enabled, Partial I/O mode can be
entered with the following command:

.. code-block:: console

   root@<machine>:~# poweroff

At this point, Linux kernel will go through its poweroff process and
the console output will stop at the following lines:

.. code-block:: text

   [   51.698039] systemd-shutdown[1]: Powering off.
   [   51.769478] reboot: Power down

The system has entered Partial I/O and can only be woken up with an
activity on the I/O pin programmed for wakeup. For example, if mcu_mcan0
wakeup was enabled, grounding Pin 22 of J8 MCU Header will wakeup the
system and it will go through a normal Linux boot process.

.. note::

   The capability to detect whether system is resuming from Partial I/O
   or doing a normal cold boot will be added in future release.

***********
Limitations
***********

HWRNG support on GP devices is incompatible with Deep Sleep and MCU Only
modes. To test LPM on GP devices, HWRNG has to be unloaded one-time
before running the Suspend-to-RAM command:

.. code-block:: console

   root@<machine>:@~# modprobe -r optee_rng

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_part_variant in ('AM62AX')

   .. attention::

      Linux SDK for edge AI applications has a known issue that breaks
      Deep Sleep and MCU Only modes. To test these modes, the DSP module
      has to be unloaded before attempting LPM:

      .. code-block:: console

         root@am62axx-evm:@~# modprobe -rf ti_k3_dsp_remoteproc
