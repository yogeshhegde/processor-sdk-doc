PCIe Root Complex
---------------------------------

.. rubric:: Introduction
   :name: introduction-linux-pcie-rc

The PCI Express (PCIe) module is a multi-lane I/O interconnect providing
low pin count, high reliability, and high-speed data transfer at rates
of up to 8.0 Gbps per lane per direction. It is a 3rd Generation I/O Interconnect
technology succeeding ISA and PCI bus that is designed to be used as a
general-purpose serial I/O interconnect in multiple market segments,
including desktop, mobile, server, storage and embedded communications.

       :name: keystone-pcie

    Keystone PCIe module is used on K2H/K2K, K2E, K2L and K2G SoCs. For more
    details on the module specification, please refers to sprugs6d.pdf
    documentation provided at ti.com. The K2G PCIe module spec is part of
    spruhy8d.pdf.

    .. rubric:: Supported platforms
       :name: supported-platforms

    SoCs: K2E, K2G

    Keystone PCIe driver may be used on K2L/K2HK and boards/EVMs using these
    SoCs, but is not validated since nothing is hooked to PCIe port on these
    EVMs.

    K2E EVM has a Marvel SATA controller (88se9182) hooked to PCIe port 1.
    The Driver is validated by connecting a SATA hard disk to the SATA port
    available on the EVM. K2G EVM has a single x1 PCIe slot which accepts
    standard PCIe cards. Following PCIe cards are validated for basic
    functionality on K2G EVM:-

    ::

        * Ethernet: Broadcom Corporation NetXtreme BCM5721 Gigabit (tg3 driver)
        * Intel Corporation 82572EI Gigabit Ethernet (e1000e driver)
        * USB: Texas Instruments TUSB73x0 SuperSpeed USB 3.0 xHCI Host
        * SATA: Marvell Technology Group Ltd. 88SE9120 SATA 6Gb/s

    K2G EVM: Make sure following jumper settings on the EVM:-

    ::

        * J44: put stub to short pin 1 & 2. This ensure proper reset to PCIe slot
        * J15: put stub to short pin 2 & 3. This ensures 100MHz clock to PCIe slot

    .. rubric:: Introduction to PCIe on TI Keystone platforms
       :name: introduction-linux-pcie

    The TI Keystone platforms contain a PCI Express module which supports a
    multi-lane I/O interconnect providing low pin count, high reliability,
    and high-speed data transfer at rates of up to 5.0 Gbps per lane per
    direction, The module supports Root Complex and End Point operation
    modes.

    The PCIe driver implemented supports only the Root Complex (RC)
    operation mode on K2 platforms (K2HK, K2E). The PCIe driver is designed
    based on PCIE Designware Core driver. The Designware Core driver is
    enhanced to support Keystone PCIe driver in the mainline kernel. The
    diagram below shows the various drivers that Keystone PCI depends on to
    implement the RC driver. PCI Designware Core driver provides a set of
    function calls defined in drivers/pci/host/pcie-designware.h for
    platform drivers to implement the RC driver. Keystone PCI module
    required some enhancements to designware core because of the application
    register space which otherwise is part of the designware core. These
    keystone specific handling of the driver is re-factored into PCI
    Keystone DW Core Driver and used from PCI Keystone platform driver. This
    includes MSI/Legacy IRQ handling, Read/Write functions to write over the
    PCI bus etc which are unique for Keystone PCI driver.

    | PCIe has been verified on K2E EVM. K2E supports two PCI ports. Port 0
      is on Domain 0 and Port 1 is on Domain 1. On K2E EVM, a Marvel SATA
      controller, 0x9182 is connected to port 1 that supports interfacing
      with Hard disk drives (HDD). Following h/w setup is used to test SATA
      HDD interface with K2E. Western Digital 1.0 TB SATA / 64MB Cache hard
      disk drive, WD10EZEX is used for the test over PCI port 1.

    Connect HDD to an external power supply. Connect the HDD SATA port to
    K2E EVM SATA port using a 6Gbps data cable and power on the HDD. Power
    On K2E EVM. The K2E rev 1.0.2.0 requires a hardware modification to get
    the SATA detection on the PCI bus. Please check with EVM hardware vendor
    for the details.

    For K2G EVM, there is a PCIe slot available to work with standard PCIe
    cards. For example to test PCIe SATA as in K2E, connect the hard disk
    SATA cables to the PCIe SATA controller card and insert the card into
    the PCIe slot and Power on the EVM. Other PCIe cards can be tested in a
    similar way.

    | The PCIe PHY (SerDes) contains the analog portion of the PHY, which is
      the transmission line channel that is used to transmit and receive
      data. It contains a phase locked loop, analog transceiver, phase
      interpolator-based clock/data recovery, parallel-to-serial converter,
      serial-to-parallel converter, scrambler, configuration, and test
      logic.

    PCI driver calls into Phy SerDes driver to initialize PCI Phy (SerDes).
    From PCI probe function, phy\_init() is called which results in SerDes
    initialization. The SerDes code is a common driver used across all sub
    systems such as SGMII, PCIe and 10G. The driver code for this located at
    drivers/phy/phy-keystone-serdes.c

    .. rubric:: Limitations
       :name: limitations

    -  PCIe is verified only on K2E and K2G EVMs
    -  AER error interrupt is not handled by PCIE AER driver for Keystone as
       this uses non standard platform interrupt
    -  ASPM interrupt is non standard on Keystone and the same is not
       handled by the PCIe ASPM driver.

    | 

    .. rubric:: U-Boot environment/scripts
       :name: u-boot-environmentscripts

    The Keystone PCIe SerDes Phy hardware requires a firmware to configure
    the Phy to work as a PCIe phy. As Keystone PCIe is statically built into
    the kernel, this firmware is needed when Phy SerDes driver is probed.
    When initramfs is used as the final rootfs, this firmware can reside at
    /lib/firmware folder of the fs. For other boot modes (mmc, ubi, nfs),
    k2-fw-initrd.cpio.gz has this firmware and can be loaded to memory and
    the address is passed to kernel through second argument of bootm
    command. Following env scripts are used to customize the u-boot
    environment for various boot modes so that firmware is available to
    initialize the phy SerDes when Phy SerDes driver is probed.

    firmware file ks2\_pcie\_serdes.bin is available in
    ti-linux-firmware.git at ti-keystone folder or at /lib/firmware folder
    of the file system images shipped with the release or under /lib/firmare
    folder of the k2-fw-initrd.cpio.gz shipped with the release). If you are
    using your own file system, make sure ks2\_pcie\_serdes.bin resides at
    /lib/firmware folder.

    Setup u-boot env as follows. These are expected to be available in the
    default env variable, but check and update it if not present.

       :name: booting-with-fs-on-harddisk

    Once the harddisk is formatted and has a rootfs installed, following
    procedure can be used to boot Linux kernel using this rootfs.

    Boot EVM to u-boot prompt. Add following env variables to u-boot
    environment :-

    ::

        K2E EVM # setenv boot hdd
        K2E EVM # setenv get_fdt_hdd 'dhcp ${fdtaddr} ${tftp_root}/${name_fdt}'
        K2E EVM # setenv init_fw_rd_hdd 'dhcp ${rdaddr} ${tftp_root}/${name_fw_rd}; run set_rd_spec'
        K2E EVM # setenv get_kern_hdd 'dhcp ${loadaddr} ${tftp_root}/${name_kern}'
        K2E EVM # setenv get_mon_hdd 'dhcp ${addr_mon} ${tftp_root}/${name_mon}'
        K2E EVM # setenv init_hdd 'run args_all  args_hdd'
        K2E EVM # setenv args_hdd 'setenv bootargs ${bootargs} rw root=/dev/sda1'
        K2E EVM # saveenv

    Now type boot command and boot to Linux. The above steps can be skipped
    once u-boot implements these env variables by default which is expected
    to be supported in the future.

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_part_variant in ('AM64X','J721E')

    .. rubric:: **Hardware Setup Details**
       :name: hardware-setup-details

    |__PART_FAMILY_DEVICE_NAMES__| is, by default, intended to be operated in 
    Root Complex mode.

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_part_variant in ('AM64X')

    Refer to the following image to toggle between Root Complex mode and End Point mode.

    .. Image:: /images/am64-pcie-rc-ep-sel.png


.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_part_variant in ('J721E')

    For End Point mode, PCIE_1L_MODE_SEL (switch 5) and PCIE_2L_MODE_SEL (switch 6) 
    should be set to '0'.

.. rubric:: **RC Software Architecture**
   :name: rc-software-architecture

Following is the software architecture for Root Complex mode:

.. Image:: /images/Linux_PCIe_subsystem.png

Following is a brief explanation of layers shown in the diagram:

- There are different drivers for the connected PCIe devices like 
  pci_endpoint_test, tg-3, r8169, xhci-pci, ahci, etc. It could be 
  vendor-specific like most of the ethernet cards (tg3, r8169) or class-specific 
  like xhci-pci and ahci. Each of these drivers will also interact with it's own 
  domain-specific stack. For example, tg3 will interface with network stack, and 
  xhci-pci will interface with USB stack.

- The PCI core layer scans the PCIe bus to identify and detect any PCIe devices.
  It also binds the driver from the layer above, for the PCIe device, based on 
  vendorid, deviceid and class.

- The PCI BIOS layer handles resource management. For example, allocation of
  memory resources for BARs.

- The bottom-most layer consists of the PCIe platform drivers like pcie-cadence, 
  pcie-designware, etc. pci-j721e and pci-dra7xx are TI's wrappers over these 
  drivers. They configure platform-specific controllers and perform 
  actual register writes.

    .. rubric:: **Testing Details**
       :name: testing-details

    The RC should enumerate any off-the-shelf PCIe cards. It has been tested 
    with Ethernet cards, NVMe cards, PCIe USB card, PCIe WiFi card, PCIe SATA 
    card and also to |__PART_FAMILY_DEVICE_NAMES__| in loopback mode.

    In order to see if the connected card is detected, lspci utility should be 
    used. Different utilities can be used depending on the cards. 
    
    Following are the outputs for some of them: 

    - Loopback mode (|__PART_FAMILY_DEVICE_NAMES__| EVM to |__PART_FAMILY_DEVICE_NAMES__| EVM)

      Two |__PART_FAMILY_DEVICE_NAMES__| EVMs can be connected in loopback mode by following
      the steps explained in
      `End Point (EP) Device Configuration <PCIe_End_Point.html#ep-device-configuration>`_ 
      section for End Point (EP) and 
      `HOST Device Configuration <PCIe_End_Point.html#host-device-configuration>`_ 
      section for Root Complex (RC) in 
      `PCIe End Point documentation. <PCIe_End_Point.html>`_ The pci-epf-test 
      driver will be configured for End Point(EP) using those steps. 
      
      The lspci output on the Root Complex (RC) device is as follows:

    .. rubric:: **J7200 Testing Details**

    PCIe and QSGMII uses the same SERDES in J7200. The default SDK is enabled for QSGMII. In order to
    test PCIe, Ethfw firmware shouldn't be loaded and PCIe overlay file should be applied.

    The simplest way to avoid ethfw from being loaded is to link j7200-main-r5f0_0-fw to IPC firmware.
    ::

        root@j7200-evm:~# rm /lib/firmware/j7200-main-r5f0_0-fw
        root@j7200-evm:~# ln -s /lib/firmware/pdk-ipc/ipc_echo_test_mcu2_0_release_strip.xer5f /lib/firmware/j7200-main-r5f0_0-fw

    The following Device Tree Overlay should be applied for testing J7200 RC.

    https://git.ti.com/cgit/ti-linux-kernel/ti-upstream-tools/tree/arch/arm64/boot/dts/ti/system_test/pcie/pcie_ep/k3-j7200-common-proc-board-pcie.dtso?h=ti-linux-5.4.y


    The following command should be given in u-boot to apply overlay

        ::

           => setenv name_overlays k3-j7200-common-proc-board-pcie.dtbo
