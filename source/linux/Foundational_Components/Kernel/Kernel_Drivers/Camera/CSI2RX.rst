CSI2RX
######

************
Introduction
************

The CSI2RX subsystem is present on some TI SoCs which facilitates the capture of
camera frames over a MIPI CSI-2 bus. The driver is based on the Video for Linux
2 (V4L2) API. It implements V4L2's Media Controller (MC) API.

*********************
Hardware Architecture
*********************

The CSI2RX subsystem is composed of 3 IPs: Cadence DPHY, Cadence CSI2RX bridge,
TI CSI2RX DMA wrapper (aka the SHIM layer).

.. Image:: /images/csi2rx-single-camera.png

The CSI2RX subsystem supports the following features:

- Compliant to MIPI CSI v1.3
- Supports up to 16 virtual channels per input (partial MIPI CSI v2.0 feature).
- Data rate up to 2.5 Gbps per lane (wire rate).
- Supports 1, 2, 3, or 4 data lane connection to DPHY_RX.
- Programmable formats including YUV420, YUV422, RGB, Raw, etc.

See the the technical reference manual (TRM) for the SoC in question for more
detailed information.

*******************
Driver Architecture
*******************

The driver is based on the Video 4 Linux 2 (V4L2) API. It is implemented
according to the V4L2 standard for capture devices. The driver is only
responsible for programming the SoC components for capture like the DPHY, CSI
bridge, DMA. For external devices like camera sensors separate V4L2 subdevice
drivers are needed.

The Media Controller API
========================

The driver is implemented using V4L2's Media Controller (MC) API. In the MC API,
each element in the media pipeline is configured individually by the user-space
application. In comparison, in the legacy or non-MC API drivers, only the
/dev/videoX node needs to be configured, and it propagates the configuration up
the chain. With this model, the MC API allows for more flexible pipeline
configurations which can all be controlled from user-space without having to
change the driver or the device tree.

For example, with the legacy API the format is set on /dev/videoX and that will
set it for the entire pipeline (sensor, bridge, DMA engine, etc). With the MC
API, the format needs to be set on each individual element in the pipeline. So
with a single camera setup, for capturing 1920x1080 @ 60fps UYVY, the camera
(/dev/v4l-subdevX) should first be configured to use that format via the V4L2
subdev ioctls. Then the /dev/videoX node (which represents the DMA context)
should be configured to use matching configuration. The Media Controller
framework checks for mismatches and reports errors if something is not right.

In similar fashion, the DMA context does not care about frame rate. It can
capture at any rate, so the driver does not implement the G_PARM or S_PARM
ioctls. Instead, the frame rate should be set on the sensor using
VIDIOC_SUBDEV_S_FRAME_INTERVAL.

- `Video for Linux API <https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/userspace-api/media/v4l/v4l2.html>`__
- `Media Controller API
  <https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/userspace-api/media/mediactl/media-controller.html>`__


Utilities to interact with the driver
=====================================

Standard V4L2 utilities can be used to set these formats and frame rates. One
such tool is :command:`media-ctl`.

To see the media pipeline to understand how all the components are connected in
software, the pipeline can be printed to the console using ``media-ctl -p``. This
would list all the elements in the pipeline, what they are connected to, and
their names. This information can then be used to set formats and frame rates on
various elements for the pipeline. For example, below command can be used to set
1920x1080 @ 30fps UYVY format on the sensor node:

.. code-block:: console

    media-ctl --set-v4l2 '"sensor-name 9-0012":0 [fmt:UYVY8_2X8/1920x1080@1/30]'

This just sets the formats on the sensor and bridge. The format on the DMA
context (/dev/videoX) needs to be set separately. This can be done while
starting the capture with :command:`yavta` for example. The below command can
be run next to start capturing the video stream to a file called
:file:`capture`:

.. code-block:: console

    yavta -c -Fcapture -s 1920x1080 -f UYVY /dev/video0

This command first sets the 1920x1080 UYVY format on the DMA context (which must
match the format on the sensor), and then starts capturing frames to a file
called :file:`capture`.

It is often useful to see the pipeline visually. media-ctl can print the
pipeline as a dot graph which can then be converted to an image for viewing. The
below set of commands can achieve this:

.. code-block:: console

    media-ctl --print-dot | dot -Tpng > graph.png

Building the driver
===================

First, enable the DPHY using CONFIG_PHY_CADENCE_DPHY. Then enable the CSI2RX
bridge using CONFIG_VIDEO_CADENCE and CONFIG_VIDEO_CADENCE_CSI2RX. Finally,
enable CONFIG_VIDEO_TI_J721E_CSI2RX. The config for the sensor should also
be enabled.

The driver can be built-in or it can be a loadable module. If the driver is
built as a module, the module will be called ``j721e-csi2rx``. Along with that,
the Cadence bridge and DPHY modules must also be loaded, which are called
``cdns-csi2rx`` and ``cdns-dphy`` respectively.

*************************************
Creating device tree nodes for sensor
*************************************

Since the sensor is a separate module and any sensor can be plugged in to the
board, the sensor device tree nodes are not included in the base dtb. Instead,
it should be added in as an overlay.

Below overlay is an example for a sensor module connected to the board using
I2C2 and CSI-RX Port 0:

Enabling camera sensors

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_part_variant in ('AM62X','AM62PX')

    |__PART_FAMILY_NAME__| SK supports the following 15-pin FFC compatible
    camera modules with **OV5640** sensor:

        1. TEVI-OV5640-\*-RPI
        2. Digilent PCam5C
        3. ALINX AN5641

    They can be tested with the following steps:

    Applying sensor overlays
    ========================

    During bootup stop at u-boot prompt by pressing any key and enable camera devicetree overlay:

    .. code-block:: text

        # For Digilent PCam5C or ALINX AN5641
        => setenv name_overlays ti/k3-am62x-sk-csi2-ov5640.dtbo
        => boot

        # For Technexion TEVI-OV5640
        => setenv name_overlays ti/k3-am62x-sk-csi2-tevi-ov5640.dtbo
        => boot

    Once the overlay is applied, you can confirm that the sensor is being
    probed by checking the output of :command:`lsmod` or the media graph:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ lsmod | grep ov5640
        ov5640                 36864  1

        ....


    Capturing raw frames
    ====================

    Once the media pipeline is configured, you should be able to capture raw
    frames from the sensor using any tool compliant with v4l2 apis. For example
    you can use libcamera to capture 20 frames @ 480p:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ cam -c1 --stream width=640,height=480,pixelformat=UYVY -C20

    You can also capture at other sensor-supported resolutions:

    .. code-block:: console

        # List supported resolutions
        $ cam -c1 -I
        # Capture 20 frames @ 1024x768
        $ cam -c1 --stream width=1024,height=768,pixelformat=UYVY -C20

    To save the raw YUV frames to SD card for viewing later use the -F option:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ cam -c1 --stream width=640,height=480,pixelformat=UYVY -C20 -F#.uyvy
        $ ls *.uyvy
        -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 614400 Jan  1 19:19 cam0-stream0-000000.uyvy
        -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 614400 Jan  1 19:19 cam0-stream0-000001.uyvy
        -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 614400 Jan  1 19:19 cam0-stream0-000002.uyvy
        -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 614400 Jan  1 19:19 cam0-stream0-000003.uyvy
        -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 614400 Jan  1 19:19 cam0-stream0-000004.uyvy

    Alternatively you can use tools like :command:`yavta` or
    :command:`v4l2-ctl`, but please note they require manual configuration
    using media-ctl if you want to stream at a different resolution and formats
    than the default (640x480 UYVY):

    .. code-block:: console

        $ yavta -s 640x480 -f UYVY /dev/video0 -c20
        ....
        $ v4l2-ctl -d0 --stream-mmap -v width=640,height=480,pixelformat=UYVY


    .. note::

        Sometimes the sensor may not stream on the first attempt after sensor
        wakes up from runtime suspend state. To make it work reliably on every
        attempt, you can **disable runtime PM** for the sensor:

        .. code-block:: console

            $ echo "on" > /sys/devices/platform/bus@f0000/20020000.i2c/i2c-2/i2c-4/4-003c/power/control

    Capture to display
    ==================

    If a display (HDMI or LVDS) is connected then use the following steps to view the camera frames:

    .. code-block:: console

        # As a window within weston desktop
        $ gst-launch-1.0 v4l2src device="/dev/video0" ! video/x-raw, width=640, height=480, format=UYVY ! autovideosink

        # Direct KMS Sink
        $ systemctl stop weston
        $ gst-launch-1.0 v4l2src device="/dev/video0" ! video/x-raw, width=640, height=480, format=UYVY ! queue ! kmssink driver-name=tidss plane-properties=s,zpos=1

    You can also replace v4l2src with libcamerasrc above if you want to test
    different sensor-supported resolutions like 480p, 720p etc.

    .. code-block:: console

        $ gst-launch-1.0 libcamerasrc ! video/x-raw, width=1024, height=768, format=UYVY ! autovideosink

    Suspend to RAM
    ==============

    The camera pipeline supports system supend to RAM on |__PART_FAMILY_NAME__|
    SK. You can refer to :ref:`Power Management <lpm_modes>` guide for more
    details.

    For example, you can start streaming from camera using any of the above
    methods and then suspend to RAM for 5 seconds using the following command:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ rtcwake -s 5 -m mem

    The system will automatically wake-up after 5 seconds, and camera streaming
    should resume from where it left (as long as the sensor supports it).

    .. attention::

        Only TEVI OV5640 module is known to work reliably when system is
        suspended with capture running. And that too, with the below patch
        applied to prevent races between different camera pipeline devices on
        system resume. This is due to V4L2 framework's async notifier
        limitations, which currently does not support sending notifications
        between subdevice drivers on wakeup from suspend state.


    The Technexion TEVI-OV5640 module supports this, but it may fail to set the
    sensor registers in time when built as a module. You can fix this by making
    it a part of the kernel image:

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_part_variant in ('AM62AX')

    SK-AM62A supports the following FPDLink cameras using fusion board: **IMX390,
    OV2312**; and the following 22-pin FFC compatible cameras: **IMX219**.

    For sensors directly connected to the SK using the FFC connector, the media
    graph is fairly simple. For example IMX219 is connected to the CSI-RX
    bridge directly, which ultimately ends up at a /dev/videoX node:

    .. Image:: /images/imx219-pipeline.png

    For sensors connected using FPDLink fusion board, the pipeline is a bit
    more complicated. For example OV2312 is a multi-stream sensor, which is
    first connected to a CSI-to-FPD serializer, and then to FPD-to-CSI
    deserializer, finally routing the two virtual channels (streams) to
    separate /dev/videoX nodes:

    .. Image:: /images/ov2312-pipeline.png

    Applying sensor overlays
    ========================

    To enable FPDLink/V3Link cameras you will need to apply the device tree
    overlays for both the deserializer board and the sensor at U-boot prompt:

    .. code-block:: text

        # For OV2312 connected on Fusion board RX Port 0:
        => setenv name_overlays ti/k3-am62a7-sk-fusion.dtbo ti/k3-fpdlink-ov2312-0-0.dtbo
        => boot

        # For RCM IMX390 connected on Fusion board RX Port 0:
        => setenv name_overlays ti/k3-am62a7-sk-fusion.dtbo ti/k3-fpdlink-imx390-rcm-0-0.dtbo
        => boot

        # For V3Link IMX219 module connected to V3Link fusion's RX Port 0:
        => setenv name_overlays ti/k3-am62x-sk-csi2-v3link-fusion.dtbo ti/k3-v3link-imx219-0-0.dtbo
        => boot

    To enable camera connected to the 22-pin FFC connector, enable the sensor
    overlay at U-boot prompt:

    .. code-block:: text

        # For IMX219 connected to 22-pin FFC connector
        => setenv name_overlays ti/k3-am62x-sk-csi2-imx219.dtbo
        => boot

    For more details on building or applying overlays permanently, refer to the
    :ref:`How to enable DT overlays in linux <howto_dt_overlays>` guide.

    Configuring media pipeline
    ==========================

    Once the overlay is applied, you can confirm that the sensor is being
    probed by checking the output of lsmod or the media graph:

    .. code-block:: console

    The sensor and other subdevs (for example FPDLink ser/deser) should
    automatically get configured by the initialization script on the SD card:

    .. code-block:: console

       IMX219 Camera 0 detected
       device = /dev/video-imx219-cam0
       name = imx219
       format = [fmt:SRGGB8_1X8/1920x1080]
       subdev_id = /dev/v4l-imx219-subdev0
       isp_required = yes

    For manual configuration, like switching to a different resolution or
    bitdepth, you can use media-ctl as `explained above
    <#utilities-to-interact-with-the-driver>`__. For example you can switch to
    10-bit 1640x1232 capture on IMX219 using:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ media-ctl --set-v4l2 '"imx219 4-0010":0[fmt:SRGGB10_1X10/1640x1232]'
        $ media-ctl --set-v4l2 '"30102000.ticsi2rx":0[fmt:SRGGB10_1X10/1640x1232]'

    and to switch it back to 8bit 1920x1080 capture :

    .. code-block:: console

        $ media-ctl --set-v4l2 '"30102000.ticsi2rx":0[fmt:SRGGB8_1X8/1920x1080]'
        $ media-ctl --set-v4l2 '"imx219 4-0010":0[fmt:SRGGB8_1X8/1920x1080]'

    Capturing raw frames
    ====================

    Once the media pipeline is configured, you should be able to capture raw
    frames from the sensor using any tool compliant with v4l2 apis. For example
    you can use :command:`yavta` to capture 100 frames from IMX219 @ 1232p:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ yavta -s 1920x1080 -f SRGGB8 /dev/video-imx219-cam0 -c100
        Device /dev/video-imx219-cam0 opened.
        yavta -s 1920x1080 -f SRGGB8 /dev/video-imx219-cam0 -c100
        Device /dev/video-imx219-cam0 opened.
        Device `j721e-csi2rx' on `platform:30102000.ticsi2rx' (driver 'j721e-csi2rx') supports video, capture, without mplanes.
        Video format set: SRGGB8 (42474752) 1920x1080 (stride 1920) field none buffer size 2073600
        Video format: SRGGB8 (42474752) 1920x1080 (stride 1920) field none buffer size 2073600
        8 buffers requested.
        ....
        length: 2073600 offset: 0 timestamp type/source: mono/EoF
        Buffer 0/0 mapped at address 0xffff95415000.
        length: 2073600 offset: 2076672 timestamp type/source: mono/EoF
        Buffer 1/0 mapped at address 0xffff9521a000.
        length: 2073600 offset: 4153344 timestamp type/source: mono/EoF
        Buffer 2/0 mapped at address 0xffff9501f000.
        length: 2073600 offset: 6230016 timestamp type/source: mono/EoF
        ....

    By default the frames are copied over to DDR and discarded later. You can
    optionally save a few frames to the SD card for debugging purposes:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ yavta -s 1920x1080 -f SRGGB8 /dev/video-imx219-cam0 -c5 -Fframe-#.bin
        ....
        $ ls -l frame-*.bin
        -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 2073600 Feb 22 05:24 frame-000000.bin
        -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 2073600 Feb 22 05:24 frame-000001.bin
        -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 2073600 Feb 22 05:24 frame-000002.bin
        -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 2073600 Feb 22 05:24 frame-000003.bin
        -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 2073600 Feb 22 05:24 frame-000004.bin

    The raw bayer frames can be viewed directly on the host machine using
    utilities like `7yuv <http://datahammer.de/7yuv_manual/index.htm>`__ or `PixelViewer
    <https://carinastudio.azurewebsites.net/PixelViewer/>`__, or converted
    using OpenCV.

    Capture to Display using ISP
    ============================

    To use the full capture to display pipeline, you can use gstreamer to call
    the required ISP components to convert the raw frames, apply
    auto-exposure/auto-white-balance algorithms and other pre-processing
    blocks.

    You may have to stop the display server (weston) before running the below
    pipelines:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ systemctl stop weston.service

    Use the following pipeline for IMX219 1920x1080 RAW8 mode:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ gst-launch-1.0 v4l2src io-mode=dmabuf-import device=/dev/video-imx219-cam0 ! video/x-bayer,width=1920,height=1080,format=rggb ! tiovxisp sensor-name=SENSOR_SONY_IMX219_RPI dcc-isp-file=/opt/imaging/imx219/linear/dcc_viss_1920x1080.bin sink_0::dcc-2a-file=/opt/imaging/imx219/linear/dcc_2a_1920x1080.bin sink_0::device=/dev/v4l-imx219-subdev0 ! video/x-raw,format=NV12 ! queue ! kmssink driver-name=tidss plane-properties=s,zpos=1

    If the sensor needs to be configured to capture at some other resolution or format
    (e.g. 1640x1232, 10bit) you can update media graph and edit the above pipeline with the new width,
    height, format and dcc-\*-file parameters:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ media-ctl --set-v4l2 '"30102000.ticsi2rx":0[fmt:SRGGB10_1X10/1640x1232]'
        $ media-ctl --set-v4l2 '"imx219 4-0010":0[fmt:SRGGB10_1X10/1640x1232]'
        $ gst-launch-1.0 v4l2src io-mode=dmabuf-import device=/dev/video-imx219-cam0 ! video/x-bayer,width=1640,height=1232,format=rggb10 ! tiovxisp sensor-name=SENSOR_SONY_IMX219_RPI dcc-isp-file=/opt/imaging/imx219/linear/dcc_viss_10b_1640x1232.bin sink_0::dcc-2a-file=/opt/imaging/imx219/linear/dcc_2a_10b_1640x1232.bin sink_0::device=/dev/v4l-imx219-subdev0 format-msb=9 ! video/x-raw,format=NV12 ! queue ! kmssink driver-name=tidss plane-properties=s,zpos=1

    For OV2312 use mosaic to display both streams together:

    .. code-block:: console

        # Mosaic of RGB and IR streams
        $ gst-launch-1.0 \
        v4l2src device=/dev/video-ov2312-rgb-cam0 io-mode=5 ! video/x-bayer, width=1600, height=1300, format=bggi10 ! queue leaky=2 ! \

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_part_variant in ('J721E')

    J721E has two instances of CSI2RX capture subsystem and can support upto
    eight **IMX390** cameras using FPDLink fusion EVM. J721E EVM and SK also
    supports **OV5640** module connected to MIPI connector. J721E SK has two
    instances of 15-pin FFC camera connector to which **IMX219** based RPi camera
    modules can be interfaced.

    Applying sensor overlays
    ========================

    To enable FPDLink cameras you will need to apply the device tree overlays
    for both the fusion board and the sensor at U-boot prompt:

    .. code-block:: text

        # For single RCM IMX390 connected to RX port 0 on Fusion board EVM on J721E CPB:
        # FPDLink IMX390 camera overlays are named according to the port connected in the following
        # format : ti/k3-fpdlink-imx390-rcm-<csi_port>-<fusion_rx_port>.dtbo
        => setenv name_overlays ti/k3-j721e-evm-fusion.dtbo ti/k3-fpdlink-imx390-rcm-0-0.dtbo
        => boot

        # For single RCM IMX390 connected to RX port 0 on Fusion board EVM on J721E SK:
        => setenv name_overlays ti/k3-j721e-sk-fpdlink-fusion.dtbo  ti/k3-fpdlink-imx390-rcm-0-0.dtbo
        => boot

    To enable IMX219 camera connected to the 22-pin FFC connectoron J721E SK,
    enable the sensor overlay at U-boot prompt:

    .. code-block:: text

        # For IMX219 connected to 15-pin FFC connector
        => setenv name_overlays ti/k3-j721e-sk-csi2-dual-imx219.dtbo
        => boot

    For more details on building or applying overlays permanently, refer to the
    :ref:`How to enable DT overlays in linux <howto_dt_overlays>` guide.

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_part_variant in ('J722S')

    J722S has two instances of CSI2RX capture subsystem and
    can support upto eight **IMX390** cameras using FPDLink fusion EVM.
    J722S also supports **OV5640** and **IMX219** module connected to MIPI connector.

    Applying sensor overlays
    ========================

    To enable FPDLink cameras you will need to apply the device tree overlays
    for both the fusion board and the sensor at U-boot prompt:

    .. code-block:: text

        # For single RCM IMX390 connected to RX port 0 on Fusion board EVM on J722S EVM:
        # FPDLink IMX390 camera overlays are named according to the port connected in the following
        # format : ti/k3-fpdlink-imx390-rcm-<csi_port>-<fusion_rx_port>.dtbo
        => setenv name_overlays ti/k3-j721s2-evm-fusion.dtbo ti/k3-fpdlink-imx390-rcm-0-0.dtbo
        => boot

    For more details on building or applying overlays permanently, refer to the
    :ref:`How to enable DT overlays in linux <howto_dt_overlays>` guide.
