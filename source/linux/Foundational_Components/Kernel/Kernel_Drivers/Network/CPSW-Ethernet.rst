Introduction
""""""""""""

The CPSW Ethernet Subsystem is capable of supporting MAC mode, Switch mode, VLAN and the
standard TSN features such as PTP, EST, CBS and IET.

.. note::
    To operate in switch mode, at least two external ports are required.

Instances of the CPSW Subsystem
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The TI |__PART_FAMILY_DEVICE_NAMES__| family of devices contain the following instances
of the CPSW Ethernet Subsystem:

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_part_family in ('J7_family')

   1. CPSW2g

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_part_variant in ('J721E','J7200','J784S4')

   2. CPSWng

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_part_family in ('J7_family')

 The CPSW2g instance is controlled by the am65-cpsw-nuss driver in Linux.
 For further details regarding the CPSW2g instance, refer :ref:`cpsw2g`

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_part_variant in ('J721E','J7200','J784S4')

 The CPSWng instance can be configured to operate in two ways:
   #. CPSWng Virtual Client
   #. CPSWng Native Ethernet

 For further details regarding the CPSWng instance, refer :ref:`cpswng`

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_part_family in ('AM62X_family','AM64X_family')

   CPSW3g

 The CPSW3g instance is a part of the Main domain and is controlled by the am65-cpsw-nuss
 driver in Linux.
 For further details regarding the CPSW3g instance, refer :ref:`cpsw3g`

TSN Documentation and Testing
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The CPSW Ethernet Subsystem supports TSN features in the following configurations:

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_part_family in ('J7_family')

   1. The CPSW2g instance supports MAC mode TSN features.

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_part_variant in ('J721E','J7200','J784S4')

   2. The CPSWng Native Ethernet configuration of the CPSWng instance supports both MAC mode
      and Switch mode TSN features.

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_part_family in ('AM62X_family','AM64X_family')

    The CPSW3g instance supports MAC mode and Switch mode TSN features.

For further details regarding the TSN features and testing, refer :ref:`tsn_with_cpsw`
