   :name: important-note

This guide is for the latest version of Matrix that is included in
Processor SDK Linux. If you are looking for information about the old
Matrix then this can be found at the following link `**Previous Version
of
Matrix** <http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php?title=Matrix_Users_Guide&oldid=74107>`__\ ***

.. rubric:: Supported Platforms
   :name: supported-platforms-matrix-ug

This version of Matrix supports **all** Sitara devices, as well as
K2H/K2K, K2E, and K2L platforms.

.. rubric:: Initial Boot Up
   :name: initial-boot-up

When you first boot up a target system which has display device attached
(e.g., AM335x, AM437x, and AM57x platforms), Matrix should be
automatically started. Matrix can be either operated by touchscreen or
mouse. Default startup for most SDK platforms is touchscreen. Should you
encounter any problems below are some tips to get everything running
smoothly. See `**Matrix Startup Debug** <#matrix-startup-debug>`__

When you boot up a target system without display (e.g., K2H/K2K, K2E,
and K2L platforms), Matrix will not be automatically started during
booting, and only
`Remote\_Matrix <http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Matrix_Users_Guide#Remote_Matrix>`__
is available for use after the booting.

.. rubric:: Overview
   :name: overview-matrix

Matrix is an HTML 5 based application launcher created to highlight
available applications and demos provided in new Software Development
Kits. There are two forms of Matrix, local and remote Matrix. All of the
example applications and demos are available using either the local or
remote version. The local version launches by default when the target
system is booted and uses the target system's touchscreen interface for
user input. Matrix comes as a 4x3 matrix of icons or as a 4x2 matrix
depending on the display resolution.

.. rubric:: Local and Remote Matrix
   :name: local-and-remote-matrix

.. rubric:: Local Matrix
   :name: local-matrix

Local Matrix refers to Matrix being displayed on a display device
attached to the target system. The launcher for Matrix is just a
simple QT application that displays a Webkit base browser that points
to the URL http://localhost:80

.. raw:: html

   <div
   style="margin: 5px; padding: 2px 10px; background-color: #ecffff; border-left: 5px solid #3399ff;">

**NOTE**
Local matrix is not available for platforms without display support, nor
the Keystone-2 platforms, such as K2H/K2K, K2E, K2L, and K2G platforms.

.. raw:: html

   </div>

.. rubric:: Remote Matrix
   :name: remote-matrix

Remote Matrix refers to Matrix being ran in any modern day web browser
not located on the target system.

The URL for Remote Matrix is http://<target system's ip address>

You can find the target's ip address by using local Matrix and clicking
on the Settings icon and then on the Network Settings icon. Or using a
terminal logged in to the target system enter the below command:

::

    ifconfig

From the output displayed, look in the section that starts with eth0.
You sould see an IP address right after "inet addr". This is the IP
address you should use for remote Matrix.

With Remote Matrix you can interact with Matrix on your PC, cellphone,
tablet, or any device with a modern web browser. You can now launch text
based applications or scripts and have the output streamed back to your
web browser! Launching a gui application from Matrix requires you to
still look at the display device connected to the target system.

.. rubric:: Matrix Project Webpage
   :name: matrix-project-webpage

The offical website for Matrix is located at
`**gforge.ti.com/gf/project/matrix-gui-v2/** <https://gforge.ti.com/gf/project/matrix-gui-v2/>`__ Any
comments or bug reports for Matrix should be posted there.

.. rubric:: How to Use the Matrix
   :name: how-to-use-the-matrix

Matrix is based on HTML 5 and is designed to be easily customizable. All
applications and submenus for Matrix can be found in the target system's
usr/share/matrix-gui-2.0/apps/ directory. Matrix utilizes the .desktop
standard along with some additional parameters to easily allow
modifying, adding and removing an application or directory.

.. rubric:: Matrix Components
   :name: matrix-components

Below is a summary of all the Matrix web pages:

.. rubric:: Menu Pages

.. rubric:: Applications
   :name: applications

-  Any application can be launched by Matrix
-  Local Matrix uses the graphics display layer. If a launched
   application also uses the graphics display layer there will be a
   conflict.

.. rubric:: Updating Matrix
   :name: updating-matrix

Matrix 2 utilizes a caching system that caches the information read from
the .desktop files and also the html that is generated from the various
php pages. While this provides a substantial performance boost,
developers must be aware that any changes to the Matrix apps folder
which includes adding, deleting and modifying files can result in many
problems within Matrix. To properly update Matrix with the latest
information, Matrix's caches need to be cleared. 

.. rubric:: Automatically Clearing Matrix Cache
   :name: automaticallyclearing-matrix-cache

The simpliest way to clear Matrix's cache is to use the Refresh Matrix
application found within Matrix's Settings submenu. Simply running the
application will cause Matrix to clear all the cached files and
regenerate the .desktops cache file. Once the application is done
running, Matrix will be updated with the latest information found from
within the apps folder.

.. rubric:: Manually Clearing Matrix Cache
   :name: manually-clearing-matrix-cache

Matrix caching system consists of 1 file and 1 directory. Within
Matrix's root directory there contains a file called json.txt. Json.txt
is a JSON file that contains information gathered from all the .desktops
located within the apps directory. This file is generated by executing
the generate.php file.

Also located in Matrix's root directory is a folder called cache. This
folder contains all of the html files cached from the various dynamic
php webpages.

To clear Matrix's caches you need to perform only two steps:

1. Execute the generate.php file.

In the terminal of the target system, enter the folllowing line of code.

::

    php generate.php

or

In a browser enter the following url. Note replace <target ip> with the
IP address of the target system.

::

    http://<target ip>:80/generate.php

Viewing generate.php in the browser should display a blank page. There
is no visual output to this webpage.

2. You need to clear the files located within Matrix's cache folder.
Enter the following commands.

::

    cd /usr/share/matrix-gui-2.0/cache
    rm -r *

Once the above steps are completed, Matrix will be updated.

.. rubric:: Launching Matrix
   :name: launching-matrix

Use the following shell script in the target's terminal window to run
Matrix as a background task:

::

    /etc/init.d/matrix-gui-2.0 start

This script ensures that the touchscreen has been calibrated and that
the Qt Window server is running.

Alternatively, Matrix can be launched manually with this full syntax:

::

    matrix_browser  -qws http://localhost:80

The “-qws” parameter is required to start the Qt window server if this
is the only/first Qt application running on the system.

The third parameter is the URL that you want the application's web
browser to go to. http://localhost:80 points to the web server on the
target system that is hosting Matrix.

.. rubric:: Matrix Startup Debug
   :name: matrix-startup-debug

The following topics cover debugging Matrix issue at startup or
disabling Matrix at start up.

.. rubric:: Touchscreen not working
   :name: touchscreen-not-working

Please see this wiki page to recalibrate the touch screen: `**How to
Recalibrate the
Touchscreen** <Processor_Linux_SDK_How_To_Guides.html#how-to-recalibrate-the-touchscreen>`__

.. rubric:: Matrix is running but I don't want it running
   :name: matrix-is-running-but-i-dont-want-it-running

#. Exit Matrix by going to the Settings submenu and running the Exit
   Matrix application. Note that exiting Matrix only shuts down local
   Matrix. Remote Matrix can still be used.
#. Or if the touchscreen is not working, from the console, type:

::

    /etc/init.d/matrix-gui-2.0 stop

 

.. rubric:: I don't want Matrix to run on boot up
   :name: i-dont-want-matrix-to-run-on-boot-up

From the console type the following commands:

::

    cd /etc/rc5.d
    mv S97matrix-gui-2.0 K97matrix-gui-2.0

| This will cause local Matrix to not automatically start on boot up.

.. rubric:: How to Enable Mouse Instead of Touchscreen for the Matrix
   :name: how-to-enable-mouse-instead-of-touchscreen-for-the-matrix

You can enable mouse by referring to the following: `**How to Enable

.. rubric:: Adding a New Application/Directory to Matrix
   :name: adding-a-new-applicationdirectory-to-matrix

Below are step by step instructions.

#. Create a new folder on your target file system at
   /usr/share/matrix-gui-2.0/apps/. The name should be a somewhat
   descriptive representation of the application or directory. The
   folder name must be different than any existing folders at that
   location.
#. Create a .desktop file based on the parameters discussed below. It is
   recommended the name of the desktop file match the name of the newly
   created folder. No white spaces can be used for the .desktop
   filename. The .desktop file parameters should be set depending on if
   you want to add a new application or a new directory to Matrix. The
   Type field must be set according to your decision. The .desktop file
   must have the .desktop suffix.
#. Update the Icon field in the .desktop to reference any existing Icon
   in the /usr/share/matrix-gui-2.0 directory or subdirectories. You can
   also add a new 96x96 png image and place it into your newly created
   folder.
#. Optionally for applications you can add a HTML file that contains the
   application description into your newly created directory. If you add
   a description page then update the X-Matrix-Description field in the
   .desktop file.
#. Refresh Matrix using the application "Refresh Matrix" located in the
   Settings submenu.


Run your new application from Matrix!
See reference examples below: `**Examples** <#examples>`__

Blank template icons for Matrix can be found here:

.. rubric:: Creating the .Desktop File
   :name: creating-the-.desktop-file

The .desktop file is based on standard specified at the
`**standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/** <http://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/>`__
Additional fields were added that are unique for Matrix.

Format for each parameter:

<Field>=<Value>

The fields and values are case sensitive.

.. rubric:: Creating a New Matrix Directory
   :name: creating-a-new-matrix-directory

You can get all the files including the image discussed below from the
following file:
`**Ex\_directory.tar.gz** </images/7/7d/Ex_directory.tar.gz>`__

Create a directory called ex\_directory

Create a new file named hello\_world\_dir.desktop

Fill the contents of the file with the text shown below:

::

    #!/usr/bin/env xdg-open 
    [Desktop Entry]
    Name=Ex Demo
    Icon=/usr/share/matrix-gui-2.0/apps/ex_directory/example-icon.png
    Type=Directory
    X-MATRIX-CategoryTarget=ex_dir
    X-MATRIX-DisplayPriority=5

This .desktop above tells Matrix that this .desktop is meant to create a
new directory since Type=Directory. The directory should be named "Ex
Demo" and will use the icon located within the ex\_directory directory.
This new directory should be the 5th icon displayed as long as there
aren't any other .desktop files that specify X-MATRIX-DisplayPriority=5
and will be displayed in the Matrix Main Menu. Now any applications that
wants to be displayed in this directory should have their .desktop
Category parameter set to ex\_dir.

-  Note that sometimes Linux will rename the .desktop file to the name
   specified in the Name field. If this occurs don't worry about trying
   to force it to use the file name specified.
-  If you are writing these files in Windows, be sure to use Unix-style
   EOL characters

Now move the .desktop file and image into the ex\_directory directory
that was created.

.. rubric:: Moving the Newly created Directory to the Target's
   File System
   :name: moving-the-newly-createddirectory-to-the-targets-filesystem

Open the Linux terminal and go to the directory that contains the
ex\_directory.

Enter the below command to copy ex\_directory to
the /usr/share/matrix-gui-2.0/apps/ directory located in the target's
file system. Depending on the targetNFS directory premissions you might
have to include sudo before the cp command.

::

    host $ cp ex_directory ~/ti-processor-sdk-linux-[platformName]-evm-xx.xx.xx.xx/targetNFS/usr/share/matrix-gui-2.0/apps/

If NFS isn't being used then you need to copy the ex\_directory to
the the /usr/share/matrix-gui-2.0/apps/ directory in the target's
filesystem.

.. rubric:: Updating Matrix
   :name: updating-matrix-1

Now in either local or remote Matrix go to the Settings directory and
click on and then run the Refresh Matrix application. This will delete
all the cache files that Matrix generates and regenerates all the needed
files which will include any updates that you have made.

Now if you go back to Matrix's Main Menu the 5th icon should be the icon
for your Ex Demo.

.. rubric:: Creating a New Application
   :name: creating-a-new-application

This example is assuming that you completed the \ `**Creating a New
Matrix Directory** <#creating-a-new-matrix-directory>`__ example.

You can get all the files including the image discussed below from the
following file:
`**Ex\_application.tar.gz** </images/b/b0/Ex_application.tar.gz>`__\ ***
***

Create a new directory called ex\_application

Create a file named test.desktop

Fill the contents of the file with the below text:

::

    #!/usr/bin/env xdg-open
    [Desktop Entry]
    Name=Test App
    Icon=/usr/share/matrix-gui-2.0/apps/ex_application/example-icon.png
    Exec=/usr/share/matrix-gui-2.0/apps/ex_application/test_script.sh
    Type=Application
    ProgramType=console
    Categories=ex_dir
    X-Matrix-Description=/usr/share/matrix-gui-2.0/apps/ex_application/app_desc.html
    X-Matrix-Lock=test_app_lock

Type=Application lets Matrix know that this .desktop is for an
application. The name of the application is "Test App". The
icon example-icon.png can be found within the ex\_application
directory. The command to execute is a shell script that will be located
within ex\_application. The script that is being ran is a simply shell
script that output text to the terminal. Therefore, the ProgramType
should be set to console. This application should be added to the Ex
Demo directory from the previous example. Therefore, Categories will be
set to ex\_dir which is the same value that X-MATRIX-CategoryTarget is
set to. You could optionally remove the Categories field to have this
application displayed in Matrix's Main Menu. This application will also
have a description page. The html file to be used is located within the
ex\_application directory. A lock is also being used. Therefore, any
other application including itself that has the same lock can't run
simultaneously.

Create a file named test\_script.sh

::

    echo "You are now running you first newly created application in Matrix"
    echo "I am about to go to sleep for 30 seconds so you can test out the lock feature if you want"
    sleep 30
    echo "I am finally awake!"

| The newly created script needs to have its permission set to be
  executable. Enter the below command to give read, write and execute
  permission to all users and groups for the script:

::

    host $ chmod 777 test_script.sh

Create a new file called app\_desc.html

::

    <h1>Test Application Overview</h1>
    <h2>Purpose:</h2>
    <p>The purpose of this application is to demonstrate the ease in adding a new application to Matrix.</p>

Now move the .desktop file, script file, the png image located in the
Ex\_application.tar.gz file and the html file into the ex\_application
folder.

.. rubric:: Moving the newly created Directory to the Target System
   :name: moving-the-newly-createddirectory-to-the-target-system

Open the Linux terminal and go to the directory that contains the
ex\_application directory.

Enter the below command to copy the ex\_application directory
to /usr/share/matrix-gui-2.0/apps/ located in the target's file system.
Depending on the targetNFS directory permissions you might have to
include sudo before the cp command.

::

    host $ cp ex_application ~/ti-processor-sdk-linux-[platformName]-evm-xx.xx.xx.xx/targetNFS/usr/share/matrix-gui-2.0/apps/

If your not using NFS but instead are using a SD card then copy
ex\_application into the /usr/share/matrix-gui-2.0/apps/ directory in
the target's filesystem.

.. rubric:: Updating Matrix
   :name: updating-matrix-2

Now in either local or remote Matrix go to the Settings directory and
click and then run the Refresh Matrix application. This will delete all
the cache files that Matrix generates and regenerate all the needed
files which will include any updates that you have made.

Now if you go back to the Matrix's Main Menu and click on the Ex
Demo directory you should see your newly created application. Click on
the application's icon and you will see the application's description
page. Click the Run button and your application will execute. If you try
to run two instances of this application simultaneously via local and
remote Matrtix you will get a message saying that the program can't run
because a lock exists. Because of X-Matrix-Lock being set to
test\_app\_lock, Matrix knows not to run two instances of a
program simultaneously that share the same lock. You can run the
application again when the previous application is done running.

You have just successfully added a new application to Matrix using all
the possibly parameters!
