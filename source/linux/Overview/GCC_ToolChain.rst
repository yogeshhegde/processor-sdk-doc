GCC ToolChain
======================================

.. http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Processor_Linux_SDK_GCC_Toolchain
.. rubric:: Overview
   :name: gcc-overview

The |__SDK_FULL_NAME__| package contains an ARM-based toolchain for Cortex
A devices. The ARM toolchain also enables hardware floating point
(hardfp) support. Older toolchains including arm-arago-linux-gnueabi-
uses software floating point (softfp). This results in software built
using a hardfp toolchain being incompatible with software built with a
softfp toolchain.

.. rubric:: ARM Toolchain
   :name: arm-toolchain

The |__SDK_FULL_NAME__| package uses an ARM-based tool chain. Other than
using a newer version of GCC, the ARM tool chain also supports hard
floating point, also known as Hard-FP. Hard-FP uses the FPU on the ARM
instead of simulating it. Older tool chains including the Arago tool
chain uses soft floating point (Soft-FP). Binaries built using a soft-fp
tool chain are not compatible with binaries built using a hard-fp.
Therefore, you must rebuild all binaries to use either hard-fp and
soft-fp since you can't mix and match. By default, all binaries included
in the |__SDK_FULL_NAME__| package will be built for hard-fp.

.. rubric:: Linux-Devkit Structure
   :name: linux-devkit-structure

Here is the structure of the Linux-devkit directory within the SDK.

+-------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Element                                         | Location                                                                            |

.. rubric:: Location in SDK
   :name: location-in-sdk

The toolchain is located in the Linux SDK in the **<SDK INSTALL DIR>/external-toolchain-dir** directory.

.. rubric:: Download ARM toolchains
   :name: download-arm-toolchains

It is stongly recommended to use the toolchain in the Processor SDK which is the version tested for TI platforms. In case the Processor SDK is not
used, the toolchain can be downloaded and the toolchain path can be set as follows. Download the toolchain from here: https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads,
and the version can be found in the u-boot release notes: :ref:`u-boot-release-notes`. The following example shows how to download and set toolchain
path in Linux Host using x86_64 architecture:

.. code-block:: console

   export AARCH32='https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Files/downloads/gnu/11.3.rel1/binrel/arm-gnu-toolchain-11.3.rel1-x86_64-arm-none-linux-gnueabihf.tar.xz'
   export AARCH64='https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Files/downloads/gnu/11.3.rel1/binrel/arm-gnu-toolchain-11.3.rel1-x86_64-aarch64-none-linux-gnu.tar.xz'
   wget -c $AARCH32 -O - | tar -xv -J -C $HOME
   wget -c $AARCH64 -O - | tar -xv -J -C $HOME
   export PATH=$HOME/arm-gnu-toolchain-11.3.rel1-x86_64-arm-none-linux-gnueabihf/bin:$PATH
   export PATH=$HOME/arm-gnu-toolchain-11.3.rel1-x86_64-aarch64-none-linux-gnu/bin:$PATH

The following sections will cover the key components of the toolchain.

.. rubric:: Cross-Compilers/Tools
   :name: cross-compilerstools

The cross-compilers and tools such as qmake2 can be found in the
**<SDK INSTALL DIR>/linux-devkit/sysroots/x86\_64-arago-linux/usr/bin** or **<SDK INSTALL DIR>/external-toolchain-dir** directories. Adding these
directories to your PATH will allow using these tools. For example:

::

 host# export PATH="<SDK INSTALL DIR>/linux-devkit/sysroots/x86_64-arago-linux/usr/bin:$PATH"

Additional tools are also located here such as the **qmake2, rcc, uic** tools
used by Qt. In addition there is a qt.conf file that can be used by tools such
as Qt creator to use the pre-built libraries found in the Linux SDK.

.. rubric:: Toolchain Prefix
   :name: toolchain-prefix

The cross-compile tools are prefixed with a unique target triplet which
indicates the architecture and OS of the output executable code. For example,
the prefix **arm-linux-gnueabihf-** indicates the ARMv7 achitecture running the
Linux OS, and thus the corresponding GCC cross compiler is called
**arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc**.

Reference the table below for all toolchain prefixes and their corresponding
architectures found in Processor SDK.

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_sdk in ('PLSDK')

    +--------------------------+--------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | Toolchain Prefix         | Architecture | Processor SDK Device                                                    |
    +--------------------------+--------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | arm-linux-gnueabihf-     | ARMv7        | am335x-evm, am437x-evm                                                  |
    +--------------------------+--------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | aarch64-none-linux-gnu-  | ARMv8        | am65xx-evm, am62xx-evm, am62xx-lp-evm, am64xx-evm, am62pxx-evm          |
    +--------------------------+--------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_sdk in ('PSDKL','j7_foundational')

    +-----------------------+--------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | Toolchain Prefix      | Architecture | Processor SDK Device                                                    |
    +-----------------------+--------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | aarch64-linux-gnu-    | ARMv8        | j721e-evm j7200-evm am65xx-evm                                          |
    +-----------------------+--------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

In an effort to be succient, the specific toolchain prefix will be replaced with
${TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX} in the examples below. In fact, the
`environment-setup script <#environment-setup-script>`__, described below, will
set this variable in your environment.

.. rubric:: Cross-Compiled Libraries
   :name: cross-compiled-libraries

The toolchain within the Linux SDK contains more than just the
cross-compiler, it also contains pre-built libraries that can be used
in your applications without requiring you to cross-compile them
yourself. These libraries include packages from alsa to zlib. The
libraries are located in the **<SDK INSTALL
DIR>/linux-devkit/sysroots/<device specific
string>-vfp-neon-linux-gnueabi/** directory. For a list of the
libraries you can refer to the software manifest found in the **<SDK
INSTALL DIR>/docs** directory or look at the list of libraries
available in the **<SDK INSTALL DIR>/linux-devkit/sysroots/<device
specific string>-vfp-neon-linux-gnueabi/usr/lib** directory. You will
also find the header files corresponding to these libraries in the
**<SDK INSTALL DIR>/linux-devkit/sysroots/<device specific
string>-vfp-neon-linux-gnueabi/usr/include** directory. Usage of these
libraries will be covered in more detail in the next sections, but as
an example if your application wants access to the alsa asound library
then you can now do the following command (assuming you have added the
cross compiler to your PATH):

::

  host# ${TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX}gcc -lasound app.c -o app.out

.. rubric:: environment-setup script
   :name: environment-setup-script

When cross-compiling packages that use configuration tools and autotools
there are many settings that are required to make sure that the proper
cross-compile libraries are used. The **environment-setup** script
located in the **<SDK INSTALL DIR>/linux-devkit** directory handles this
for you. This script exports variables to perform actions such as:

-  Adding the toolchain to the PATH
-  Setting up CPATH
-  Setting up PKG\_CONFIG\_\* paths
-  Setting standard variable such as CC, CPP, AR to the cross-compile
   values

To **use** the environment-setup script you only need to source it. This
is as simple as:

::

  host# source linux-devkit/environment-setup

To know if the environment setup script has been sourced in your current
shell the shell prompt will be changed to contain the
**[linux-devkit]:** prefix in the command prompt.

The `Usage <#usage>`__ section below will cover some cases where
using the environment-setup script is useful.

.. rubric:: When Compiling the Linux Kernel
   :name: when-compiling-the-linux-kernel

Because environment-setup changes standard variables such as CC you
should not use this script when compiler projects that build host-side
as well as target-side tools. A prime example of this is the Linux
kernel, which builds some host side tools to help during the kernel
build. If the environment-setup script has been sourced then the CC
value will specify the cross-compiler for the host-side tool build. This
means that the tools compiled and used during the kernel build will be
compiled for the ARM platform while the kernel build tries to run these
tools on an Intel platform. This will cause the tools to fail to run and
the kernel to fail to compile.

.. rubric:: Usage

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_sdk in ('PSDKL','j7_foundational')

    The following sections give some examples of how to use the included
    toolchain to compile a simple *HelloWorld* application.

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_sdk not in ('PSDKL','j7_foundational')

    The following sections give some examples of how to use the included
    toolchain to compile simple applications such as *HelloWorld* to more
    complex examples such as configuring and compiler GStreamer plugins.

.. rubric:: Simple Cross-Compile
   :name: simple-cross-compile

In the simplest case the cross-compiler can be used to compile simple
applications that just need access to standard libraries. The two
examples below cover an application that uses only the standard libgcc
libraries and another example that uses the pthreads threading library.

.. rubric:: HelloWorld
   :name: helloworld

Simple applications like **HelloWorld** can be compiled using just a
call to the cross-compiler since the cross-compiler can find the
libraries it was built with without any issues. The following steps will
show how to make a simple helloworld application and cross-compile that
application.

Create a **helloworld.c** file

.. code-block:: c

    #include <stdio.h>
     
     int main() {
         printf ("Hello World from TI!!!\n");
         return 0;
     }

Cross-compile the **helloworld.c** file using the cross-compile
toolchain. In this example we will invoke the toolchain without it
having been added to our PATH.

|

::

  host# <SDK INSTALL DIR>/linux-devkit/sysroots/x86_64-arago-linux/usr/bin/${TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX}gcc helloworld.c -o helloworld

|

After the above steps are run you should now have a **helloworld**
executable in your directory that has been compiled for the ARM. A
simple way to check this is to run the following command:

|

::

  host# file helloworld

This should yield output like:

::

  helloworld: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM, EABI5 version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib/ld-linux-armhf.so.3, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, with debug_info, not stripped

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_sdk not in ('PSDKL','j7_foundational')

    .. rubric:: Using PThreads
       :name: using-pthreads

    In many cases your simple application probably wants to use additional
    libraries than the standard libgcc and glibc libraries. In this case
    you will need to include the header files for those libraries as well
    as add the library to the compile line. In this example we will look
    at how to build a simple threading application and use the pthread
    library. This example was derived from the example code at
    `**http://www.amparo.net/ce155/thread-ex.html** <http://www.amparo.net/ce155/thread-ex.html>`__

    Create a file **thread-ex.c** with the following contents

    |

    .. code:: c

        #include <unistd.h>;
        #include <sys/types.h>;
        #include <errno.h>;
        #include <stdio.h>;
        #include <stdlib.h>;
        #include <pthread.h>;
        #include <string.h>;
         
        int print_message_function(void *ptr);
         
        /* struct to hold data to be passed to a thread
        this shows how multiple data items can be passed to a thread */
        typedef struct str_thdata
        {
            int thread_no;
            char message[100];
        } thdata;
         
        int main(int argc, void **argv)
        {
            pthread_t thread1, thread2;
            thdata data1, data2;
         
            data1.thread_no = 1;
            strcpy(data1.message, "Hello!");
         
            data2.thread_no = 2;
            strcpy(data2.message, "Hi!");
         
            pthread_create (&thread1, NULL, (void *) &print_message_function, (void *) &data1);
            pthread_create (&thread2, NULL, (void *) &print_message_function, (void *) &data2);
         
            pthread_join(thread1, NULL);
            pthread_join(thread2, NULL);
         
            exit(0);
        }
         
        int print_message_function ( void *ptr )
        {
            thdata *data;
            data = (thdata *) ptr;  /* type cast to a pointer to thdata */
         
            /* do the work */
            printf("Thread %d says%s \n", data->thread_no, data->message);
         
            return 0;
        }

    |

    Cross-compile the **thread-ex.c** file using the cross-compile
    toolchain. In this example we will first add the toolchain to our PATH.
    This only needs to be done once. We will also add the pthread library to
    the compile line so that we will link with the library file that
    provides the pthread\_\* functions.


    ::

      host# export PATH="<SDK INSTALL DIR>/linux-devkit/sysroots/x86_64-arago-linux/usr/bin/:$PATH"

      host# ${TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX}gcc -lpthread thread-ex.c -o thread-ex


.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_sdk not in ('PSDKL','j7_foundational')

    .. rubric:: Configure/Autotools
       :name: configureautotools

    The last case to cover is one where the **environment-setup** script is
    useful. In this case we will download the **gst-plugins-bad** package and
    configure and build it using the environment-setup script to configure
    the system for the **autotools** to properly detect the libraries
    available as pre-built libraries.

    #. First download the
       `gst-plugins-bad-0.10.11.tar.gz <http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/src/gst-plugins-bad/gst-plugins-bad-0.10.11.tar.gz>`__
       package
       wget
       http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/src/gst-plugins-bad/gst-plugins-bad-0.10.11.tar.gz

       .. raw:: html

          <div
          style="margin: 5px; padding: 5px 10px; background-color: #ffffec; border-left: 5px solid #ff6600;">

       **IMPORTANT**
       In order to build the gst-plugins-bad package you will need
       libglib2.0-dev installed on your system. You can install this using
       **sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-dev**

       .. raw:: html

          </div>

    #. Extract the plugins tarball
       **tar zxf gst-plugins-bad-0.10.11.tar.gz**
    #. Change directory into the extracted sources
       **cd gst-plugins-bad-0.10.11**
    #. Source the **<SDK INSTALL DIR>/linux-devkit/environment-setup**
       script to prepare to configure and build the plugins.
       **source <SDK INSTALL DIR>/linux-devkit/environment-setup**
    #. Now configure the package. We need to define the *host* setting to
       tell the configuration utility what our host system is, and we will
       also disable some plugins that are known to be bad.
       **./configure --host=i686 --disable-deinterlace2 --disable-x264**
    #. When the configuration is done the last sections will show which
       plugins will be build based on the libraries available. This is the
       key point behind what the environment-setup script provides. By
       setting up the PKG\_CONFIG\_\* paths and other variables the
       configure script was able to check for required libraries being
       available to know which plugins to enable. Now that the sources have
       been configured you can compile them with a simple make command.
       **make**
