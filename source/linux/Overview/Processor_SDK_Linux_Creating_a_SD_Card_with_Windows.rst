Windows SD Card Creation Guide
======================================
.. rubric:: Introduction
   :name: introduction-linux-sd-card

This page details how to use an image file to create a SD Card
containing the embedded Linux system provided with the Linux SDK. This
allows a user to evaluate the embedded system on a supported hardware
platform.

.. rubric:: What is Needed
   :name: what-is-needed

-  Access to a Windows PC
-  A valid Linux SDK image for the appropriate processor (AM335x, for
   example)
-  Software to decompress a zip file (ex. 7-zip)
-  Software to write an image file to a SD card
-  A SD card appropriate for the required hardware platform, must be 16GB
   or larger
-  A SD card reader/writer

.. rubric:: Steps to Follow
   :name: steps-to-follow

Here is the process to follow to create the SD card.

#. Download the Processor SDK for Linux image file that you want to use.
#. On a Windows PC, you'll need software to decompress a zip file.
   Windows 7 can do this natively. If you don't already have something
   that works, the open source software `7-zip <http://www.7-zip.org>`__
   is a great choice. Since this image is created with lots of empty
   space, this step saves about 700 MB of download time.
#. Use the decompression software to decompress the zipped file to an
   image file. Here's how to do it with 7-zip:

   .. Image:: /images/7zip_to_extract_image.png

   You should see a status bar as the image is decompressed:

   .. Image:: /images/Win32_Disk_Imager_Extracting.png

   And this is what you should have when it is finished:

   .. Image:: /images/7zip_image_file_extracted.png

#. If you don't have it already, download a program to write the image
   file to the SD card. The open source `Win32 Disk
   Imager <http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager>`__ is a good
   option.
#. Use the software for writing an image to disk to write the
   decompressed .img file to the SD card.

   #. Plug the SD card into the SD card reader/writer.
   #. Insert the SD card reader/writer into the PC.
   #. Launch the disk writer software, if needed.
   #. Choose the image file for the SDK that you want to write.

      .. Image:: /images/Win32_Disk_Imager_open.png

      And select the appropriate SDK Image file:

      .. Image:: /images/Win32_disk_imager_select_a_disk_image.png

   #. Choose the SD card as the destination.

      .. Image:: /images/Win32_Disk_Imager_select_disk.png

   #. Write the image to the SD card.

      .. Image:: /images/Win32_Disk_Imager_write_disk.png

      .. note::
          You'll likely get the below confirmation box. This command will
          overwrite whatever disk you point it to, please make sure and choose
          the correct disk:

      .. Image:: /images/Win32_disk_imager_Confirm_overwrite.png

      You should see the following status bar as the image is being
      written to the disk:

      .. Image:: /images/Win32_Disk_Imager_writing_to_disk.png

      And when the write is complete, you should get a notification:

      .. Image:: /images/Win32_Disk_Imager_Complete.png

      You can now close the image writing program:

      .. Image:: /images/Win32_Disk_Imager_exit.png

#. Safely eject the SD card from the computer. Here's an example using
   Windows 7:

.. Image:: /images/Win7_eject_disk.png

.. Image:: /images/Win7_eject_disk_detail.png

.. Image:: /images/Win7_device_can_be_safely_removed.png

#. Plug it into a supported hardware platform and boot the platform from
   the SD card.
#. If the platform has a display (Starterkit, for example), you should
   see the Matrix application from the SDK. If the hardware does not
   have a display, you should be able to access Matrix remotely through
   a web browser if the PC and the board are on a common network. You
   can also connect to the board using a terminal emulator (ex. Tera
   Term) in order to view the serial console and interact with the
   embedded Linux system (ex. run ifconfig to get the IP address of the
   target board in order to connect to it to view remote matrix).
