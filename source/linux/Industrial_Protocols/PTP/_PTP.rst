Overview
===========

The Precision Time Protocol (PTP), defined in IEEE 1588, is a protocol
used to synchronize clocks throughout a network. Many applications in
Industrial automation, Grid Infrastructure, Motion Control, AVB, and
Telecom markets require nano-second accuracy/precision, varied update
rates, rapid reconfiguration after network changes, fault tolerance.
TI's Sitara hardware platforms have dedicated hardware/firmware that
help us meet these stringent requirements for synchronizing the
distributed real-time clocks, in conjunction with LinuxPTP Application
Stack. This page is specific to the PTP implementation in Linux, and the
following sections provide details about the Software Architecture,
Supported platforms, test setup and details about the support for
Ordinary Clock (OC), Boundary Clock (BC) And Transparent Clock (TC)

linuxptp Overview
-----------------

The Linux PTP Project is a software implementation of the PTP according
to the IEEE 1588 Standard. This software is licensed under GNU GPL
License, as described in the Processor SDK Software Manifest. For more
details on Linux PTP framework and implementation refer:
http://linuxptp.sourceforge.net/

LinuxPTP provides the four user applications - ptp4l, phc2sys,
hwstamp\_ctl and pmc. The definition and usage of these applications is
as follows:

-  ptp4l: It is the main program that implements the Precision Time
   Protocol (PTP) according to IEEE standard 1588 for Linux, as a
   Boundary Clock (BC) and Ordinary Clock (OC). The 'slave' and 'master'
   roles are determined for each port automatically using the BMC
-  phc2sys: It is a utility program to synchronize the normal Linux
   system time to a PTP Hardware Clock - which itself is synchronized by
   the ptp4l program/application. For phc2sys, the terms 'slave' and
   'master' are not about the PTP, but rather about two local clocks.
   Usually, the Linux system time is the slave, and the PHC is the
   master.
-  pmc: This is a utility program for sending PTP management queries.
   The program reads from the standard input actions specified by name
   and management ID, sends them over the selected transport and prints
   any received replies.
-  hwstamp\_ctl: It is just a test program for the SIOCSHWTSTAMP ioctl,
   used for debugging. The ptp4l program does not need this program to
   function

TI has forked LinuxPTP to add support for Sitara family of devices, and
the repo is hosted here: http://git.ti.com/processor-sdk/linuxptp

Hardware Overview
=================

TI’s Sitara devices have support for GMAC and PRU-ICSS ports, as shown
in the table below.

+--------------------------+--------------------------+--------------------------+-----------------------+
| SoC                      | # of GMAC ports          | # of PRU-ICSS ports      | PRU Firmware Supported|
+==========================+==========================+==========================+=======================+
| AM335x                   | 1                        | 2(at 100Mbps)            | Dual EMAC             |
+--------------------------+--------------------------+--------------------------+-----------------------+
| AM437x                   | 1                        | 2(at 100Mbps)            | Dual EMAC             |
+--------------------------+--------------------------+--------------------------+-----------------------+
| AM571x                   | 1                        | 4(at 100Mbps)            | Dual EMAC / HSR / PRP |
+--------------------------+--------------------------+--------------------------+-----------------------+
| AM572x                   | 1                        | 2(at 100Mbps)            | Dual EMAC / HSR / PRP |
+--------------------------+--------------------------+--------------------------+-----------------------+
| AM574x                   | 1                        | 2(at 100Mbps)            | Dual EMAC / HSR / PRP |
+--------------------------+--------------------------+--------------------------+-----------------------+

When using PTP as SAN port, only 1 port of each PRU-ICSS can independently
support PTP at a time e.g. on AM571x, there are 4 PRU-ICSS ports, but only 1
from each of the 2 PRU-ICSS can be used as SAN PTP ports independently (as
OC slaves) for a total of 2 ports since each PRU-ICSS functions as a single PTP
clock entity.

GMAC
-----

GMAC interface can be configured to run at either 100 Mbps or 1 Gbps.
CPTS hardware block helps with timestamping of packets. Refer to
`here <Foundational_Components/Kernel/Kernel_Drivers/Network/CPSW.html#common-platform-time-sync-cpts>`__
for details.

PRU-ICSS
---------

The processing load is shared between firmware (PRU) and Host (ARM) with
the firmware doing most of the time critical activities. The IEP
hardware block in the PRU-ICSS sub-system is responsible for
timestamping of packets. Memory map for the firmware interface for HSR/PRP
firmware can be found in :ref:`HSR_PRP_Firmware_Memory_Map_label`.

.. _SITARA_PTP_HW_Mods-label:

Hardware Modifications
----------------------
-   Hardware modifications are required on the AM57xx IDK platforms to provide
    access points to 1 PPS sync and latch signals for CPSW/CPTS and PRU-ICSS modules
-   For Boundary Clock, since PPS generated by one internal clock needs to be latched
    into another internal clock, hardware, mainly blue wire, modifications are needed
    in order to achieive the latching of the PPS generated by one internal clock into
    another internal clock.

Please refer to `AM571x-IDK modifications <http://processors.wiki.ti.com/images/3/34/Am571x_idk_pps_ModList.pdf>`_
and `AM572x-IDK/AM574x-IDK  modifications <http://processors.wiki.ti.com/images/2/2f/Am572x_am574x_idk_pps_ModList.pdf>`_
documents and
make the recommended changes to verify OC and BC, and to get access to 1 PPS signals

Generating 1 PPS
================

The PPS (Pulse Per Second) or 1PPS signal is an electrical signal that
has a width of less than one second and a sharply rising or abruptly
falling edge at the second boundary. The PPS signal can be used to
measure the offset and jitters of the system time between the master and
slave clock. This signal can also be used to synchronize the slave clock
to its master within a BC.

Device Tree Setup
-----------------

To enable PPS the device needs to first be booted using a different device tree
file to enable the PPS pins, as listed below:

+--------------------------+------------------------------+
| SoC                      | Device Tree File (\*.dtb)    |
+==========================+==============================+
| AM335x                   | am335x-icev2-prueth-pps.dtb  |
+--------------------------+------------------------------+
| AM437x                   | am437x-idk-pps.dtb           |
+--------------------------+------------------------------+
| AM571x                   | am571x-idk-pps.dtb           |
+--------------------------+------------------------------+
| AM572x                   | am572x-idk-pps.dtb           |
+--------------------------+------------------------------+
| AM574x                   | am574x-idk-pps.dtb           |
+--------------------------+------------------------------+

To configure this, change the device tree loaded in Uboot. If using the default
Uboot environment, you can make the following changes to force the device to
boot using the PPS device tree file.

1. Disable the automatic device tree file selection. Remove 'run findfdt;' from
the relevant boot command (e.g. 'bootcmd', mmcboot' or 'netboot')

2. Set the device tree file to be used.

::

 setenv fdtfile <PPS dtb>


PRU-ICSS IEP
-------------

IEP has an additional hardware to generate a programmable sync output
which is tied to the IEP counter. This is called the SYNC unit. For this
signal generation CMP1 is programmed to a value of 1 second. A HIT event
is generated by PRU0. Linux PRUETH IEP driver checks this event in and
re-programs CMP1 after every hit to ensure that accurate sync pulses are
generated. This sync is equivalent to the 1PPS output and should not be
confused with PTP Sync frame.

To enable/disable 1PPS signal on PRU-ICSS port, enter the following
commands respectively

::

    echo 1 > /sys/class/ptp/ptp1/pps_enable
    echo 0 > /sys/class/ptp/ptp1/pps_enable
    or
    echo 1 > /sys/class/ptp/ptp2/pps_enable
    echo 0 > /sys/class/ptp/ptp2/pps_enable

::

    echo 1 > /sys/class/ptp/ptp2/pps_enable
    echo 0 > /sys/class/ptp/ptp2/pps_enable
    or
    echo 1 > /sys/class/ptp/ptp1/pps_enable
    echo 0 > /sys/class/ptp/ptp1/pps_enable

Please note that both ptp1/2 may be assigned to pruss1(2)\_eth based on
the order of operations. Use the following command to find out the
assigned PTP ports.

::

    ethtool -T eth2/3 | grep "PTP Hardware Clock"
    ethtool -T eth4/5 | grep "PTP Hardware Clock"

.. note::
    Known Issue: On AM335x/AM437x, the current PPS implementation has the
    possibility of failing to correctly synchronize PPS output to a master
    (only the PPS output is affected, the PTP functionality still succeeds).
    This appears as the slave PPS being offset from the master PPS signal on
    an order of 40-100ms either on starting PPS or after running for an
    extended period of time. As a workaround, if PPS output is observed to be
    offset, then to temporarily stabilize PPS output for measurement,
    bring down and then bring back up the ethernet interface in use to
    reset PTP/PPS (e.g. ifconfig eth1 down/ifconfig eth1 up). If the PPS
    output is successful, then the output is valid and can be used to
    measure jitter.

GMAC
------

The GMAC/CPTS does not support a programmable sync output. Instead, the
GP Timer16 can be programmed to generate an output pulse every 100ms or
second and then this signal is passed to CPTS/HW\_TS\_PUSH4 to trigger
the HW\_TS\_PUSH event. Refer to :ref:`SITARA_CPTS_Module-label` for details.

.. _SITARA_PTP_OC-label:

PTP Ordinary Clock
==================

PTP ordinary clock (OC) is supported on both the CPSW GMAC ports and the
PRU-ICSS ports.

The **IEEE-1588-2009** standard defines **ordinary clock** as "A clock
that has a single Precision Time Protocol (PTP) port in a domain and
maintains the timescale used in the domain. It may serve as a source of
time, i.e., be a master clock, or may synchronize to another clock,
i.e., be a slave clock."

At the heart of the ordinary clock support is the capability of being
able to timestamp the PTP event messages that passes through the
different Ethernet ports. It is the CPTS module that does the
timestamping for the CPSW GMAC ports. For PRU-ICSS ports, it is the IEP
module together with the PRU firmware that does the timestamping.

.. rubric:: PHY Delay Compensation
   :name: phy-delay-compensation

The IEEE1588 timestamp should be measured at the Ethernet wire and
therefore the ideal place to measure the egress/ingress timestamp of the
Ethernet packets is at the Ethernet PHY. Unfortunately it is usually not
the case. The delay between the actual timestamp location and the ideal
location at the Ethernet wire will add to the path delay and create
error of the path delay and offset of the system timestamp if the egress
and ingress delay is not symmetric.

The Linux PTP software stack is designed to handle those delays with
environment variable egressLatency and ingressLatency. Both delay number
should be calculated or measured and used at the PTP configuration file.
In the case that those two number are not available, use the following
formulas to adjust those two variables as long as the measured path
delay by Linux PTP is positive.

::

    To reduce the 1PPS offset by x, increase the asymmetry delay compensation by 2x
    To reduce the end-to-end delay by y, increase both ingressLatency and egressLatency by y.

PTP Ordinary Clock on PRU-ICSS
------------------------------

Timestamping of PTP event messages at the PRU-ICSS ports is provided by
the PRU-ICSS IEP module together with the PRU firmware. PTP is supported via
the Dual EMAC firmware. PTP with redundancy is supported via both HSR and
PRP firmware.

In this Linux PRU-ICSS OC implementation, the PRU firmware stores
timestamps (IEP counter values) of PTP event messages in specific shared
memory locations. The PRU IEP driver retrieves the timestamps and
converts them into PTP time values (in nanoseconds) before they are
passed to upper layer for further processing. The current PRU-ICSS PTP
clock frequency and time scale are kept in the IEP driver.

Since the PRU IEP drivers implements the Linux PTP hardware clock
subsystem APIs, the PRU-ICSS PTP clock can therefore be adjusted by
using those standard APIs. See `PTP hardware clock infrastructure for
Linux <https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/ptp/ptp.txt#>`__ for
more details.

The PTP OC protocol is provided by the linuxptp application.

::

    ptp4l -f oc.cfg

oc.cfg is a ptp4l configuration file.

Example oc.cfg for OC,

::

    [global]
    tx_timestamp_timeout 10
    logMinPdelayReqInterval -3
    logSyncInterval -3
    twoStepFlag 1
    summary_interval 0
    [eth2]
    egressLatency 726
    ingressLatency 186
    delay_mechanism P2P
    network_transport L2

where **eth2** is the intended PRU-ICSS Ethernet port over which the OC
functionality is provided.

See `The Linux PTP Project <http://linuxptp.sourceforge.net#>`__ for
more details about linuxptp in general and `ptp4l(8) - Linux man
page <https://man.cx/ptp4l>`__ about ptp4l configurations in particular.

To set up PTP OC over HSR/PRP redundant interface, first setup HSR/PRP interface
as detailed in `HSR/PRP Linux Software <Industrial_Protocols_HSR_PRP.html#linux-software>`__.

Start PTP with the same command listed above, but using a different
configuration file:
(where eth2/eth3 are the slave interfaces used for the HSR/PRP interface)

E2E/IPv4 (Telecom Profile)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Support for E2E message types, IPv4 transport, and unicast negotation enables
use of the Telecom profile. This is also supported by LinuxPTP, and may be
configured using a configuration file similar to the one below:
(Note: only supported on PRU-ICSS ports using DualEMAC, and supports slave side only)

In above example config, 192.168.1.94 is the IP of the PTP master for this device.


VLAN
^^^^
PTP can also operate over VLAN interfaces, which can either be standard
ethernet or HSR/PRP VLAN interfaces. In both cases, the only change needed is
to specify the VLAN interface as the PTP interface in the PTP config file. In
the case of HSR/PRP VLAN, the HSR/PRP interface will be the VLAN enabled
interface (not the slave interfaces) and is the only interface that would need
to be changed in the config file. For example, in the above HSR/PRP PTP config
files, the only change needed would to change "[hsr0]" or "[prp0]" to
appropriate VLAN interfaces e.g. "[hsr0.2]" or "[prp0.2]"

Some useful commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To see the availability of ICSS-PRU1 and ICSS-PRU2 on SoC:

::

    root@am57xx-evm:~# ls /sys/devices/platform/

and look for **pruss1\_eth** and/or **pruss2\_eth**.

To see which interface is configured under, for example, ICSS-PRU2:

::

    root@am57xx-evm:~# ls /sys/devices/platform/pruss2_eth/net
    eth2/ eth3/

To see what is available under an ICSS-PRU ptp support:

::

    root@am57xx-evm:~# ls /sys/class/ptp/ptp1
    clock_name             fifo                   n_periodic_outputs     pps_available

    PRUSS1 timer

::

    root@am57xx-evm:~# cat /sys/class/ptp/ptp1/pps_available
    1

If ptp4l is started in the background and without the "-m" option to
print any message to standard output, the system log file
/var/log/messages can be used to get a glimpse of the progress of ptp4l.
For example,

::

    root@am57xx-evm:~# ptp4l -2 -P -f oc.cfg &

PHY Delay Compensation for AM57xx IDK
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The accuracy of PTP time provided by an OC depends in part on the
accountability of the latencies introduced by the Ethernet of PHY and
the timestamping point at which a PTP event message is timestamped.

IEEE-1588-2009 specifies that timestamp should be taken right after the
SOF (start of frame). For Ethernet this is right after the SFD (start
frame delimiter) or right before the destination MAC address. In the
case of PRU-PRP firmware, only SOF timestampping is available for a TX
PTP event message. And because in a 100 mbps line speed, 1 bit time is
equivalent to 10ns, hence 640 ns ( (7 bytes preamble + 1 byte SFD) \* 8
bits \* 10ns) needs to be compensated in the TX direction.

Furthermore, the PRU-ICSS PHY TLK110 on AM57xx IDK introduces a latency
of 86 ns in the TX and 186 ns in the RX direction.

Thus a total of 640 + 86 = 726 ns in the TX direction and 186 ns in the
RX direction need to be accounted for.

When linuxptp's ptp4l is used as the PTP protocol application, the
following should be used for IngressLatency and EgressLatency
configuration respectively.

+--------------------------+--------------------------+--------------------------+
| Speed                    | Egress Latency (ns)      | Ingress Latency (ns)     |
+==========================+==========================+==========================+
| 100Mb                    | 726                      | 186                      |
+--------------------------+--------------------------+--------------------------+

This also explains the two lines that corresponds to egressLatency and
ingressLatency in the sample ptp4l configuration file oc.cfg in the
ptp4l example above.

Limitations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Although there are two Ethernet ports available on each ICSS-PRU
present, ICSS-PRU PTP OC can only be supported on at most **ONE** such
port. It cannot provide PTP OC functionality on both Ethernet ports on
the same ICSS-PRU simultaneously.

PTP Ordinary Clock on GMAC
---------------------------
Refer to `here <Foundational_Components/Kernel/Kernel_Drivers/Network/CPSW.html#common-platform-time-sync-cpts>`__
for more details about the CPTS driver and how to run **linuxptp** over the CPSW GMAC port
for providing the PTP OC functionality.

For example, once the AM57xx IDK is boot into Linux kernel prompt and
the CPSW GMAC ports are properly configured, to run linuxptp over the
GMAC port, do

::

    ptp4l -2 -P -f oc_eth1.cfg -s -m

oc\_eth1.cfg is a ptp4l configuration file.

Example oc\_eth1.cfg for OC,

::

    [global]
    tx_timestamp_timeout 10
    logMinPdelayReqInterval -3
    logSyncInterval -3
    twoStepFlag 1
    summary_interval 0
    [et1]
    egressLatency 146
    ingressLatency 246

where **eth1** is the intended GMAC port over which the OC functionality
is provided.

Here is a sample screen display of ptp4l for GMAC port as PTP/OC in
slave mode:

PTP Transparent Clock with PRU RSTP switch
==========================================

The PRU ethernet subsystem on AM57x IDKs can be used as PTP Transparent Clock
with PRU RSTP switch firmware. PTP packets are not cut through but sent to
host Linux so linuxptp can process them and operate correctly.

Test Setup/Procedure
--------------------

To test Transparent Clock on AM57x IDK we will need two more devices to operate
as Ordinary Clock master and slave. In the below example we use a beagle bone
as OC master and AM65x-IDK as OC slave.

AM571x-IDK TC setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Plug Beaglebone ethernet to eth2 port of AM571x-IDK. Plug eth3 port of AM571x-IDK to eth5 port of AM65x-IDK.
You can use any Ethernet port of AM65x-IDK but make sure to update the oc.cfg file accordingly.

Put PRU Ethernet ports to RSTP switch mode.

PTP Boundary Clock
==================

PTP boundary clock (BC) is supported on AM571x, AM572x and AM574x IDKs.
In the case of AM571x IDK, BC with two to five ports is supported. These
five ports can be any combination of GMAC and PRU ports, i.e., GMAC
port, one or two ICSS1 PRU ports and one or two ICSS2 PRU ports. In the
case of AM572x or AM574x IDK, BC with three ports, i.e., GMAC port and
one or two ICSS2 PRU port, is supported.

Hardware Overview
-----------------

For AM57xx IDK BC, since PPS generated by one internal clock needs to be
latched into another internal clock, hardware, mainly blue wire,
modifications are needed in order to achieve the latching of the PPS
generated by one internal clock into another internal clock.

Refer to the :ref:`SITARA_PTP_HW_Mods-label`

Test Setup/Procedure
--------------------

Sample BC Setups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A sample set up for 3-port BC for testing purpose is shown below.

.. Image:: /images/Bc_connect.jpg

In this scenario, the BC ICSS2 PRU port (interface eth2) is in PTP
slave state (ICSS2-IEP is the BC internal master clock). The other two
ports, BC ICSS1 (interface eth4) and BC CPSW/CPTS (interface eth1) are
in PTP master state (ICSS1-IEP and CPTS are the BC internal slave
clocks).

A sample set up for BC with HSR/PRP ports for testing purpose is shown
below.

.. Image:: /images/Bc_dan_connect.jpg

In this scenario, the BC CPSW/CPTS (interface eth1) is in PTP
slave state (CPTS is the BC internal master clock). The other two
ports, BC ICSS1 (interface eth4/eth5) and BC ICSS2 (interface eth2/3) are
in PTP master state (ICSS1-IEP and ICSS2-IEP are the BC internal slave
clocks).


.. rubric:: Getting a PTP master clock ready
   :name: getting-a-ptp-master-clock-ready

Start a reference PTP master clock that is connected in the PTP network
as shown in the `sample setup <#sample-bc-setups>`__.

If the PTP master clock is an AM572x OC running linuxptp ptp4l, and for
testing purpose, a line such as

::

    clockClass 6

in the [global] section of the OC's linuxptp configuration file can be
helpful to make sure that the OC will be a master clock. Refer to
:ref:`SITARA_PTP_OC-label` for starting an AM57xx OC.

   :name: preparation-on-the-am57xx-bc-idk

This section assumes that an AM571x is used. It should be similar for

See a complete sample log for AM571x BC log
`here <http://processors.wiki.ti.com/images/2/20/Bc_20180112.pdf>`__. As
is shown in the log, right after the root login, the content of some
shell scripts are displayed. Some of the scrits are for retrieving
system information while others are for performing configurations. These
sample scripts are for informational purpose only.

Bring up the interfaces similar to the procedure for Ordinary Clock.

Start ptp4l in the background and with display log to stdout enabled:

::

    $ ptp4l -f bc.cfg -m &

Wait to see the PTP slave port clock is sync and stabilized, for
example, seeing similar lines:

::

    ptp4l[304.713]: rms    7 max   12 ( -12,    1) freq  -8253 +/-   4 delay     7 +/-   1
    ptp4l[305.714]: rms    2 max    4 (  -4,    2) freq  -8248 +/-   3 delay     8 +/-   0
    ptp4l[306.714]: rms    2 max    3 (  -3,    3) freq  -8248 +/-   3 delay     8 +/-   0

then start phc2sys to perform the BC internal clock sync in the
background

::

    $ phc2sys -a -m &

Lines similar to the following should be displayed after a few seconds
(mixed with the "ptp4l[304.713]: rms ..." lines from ptp4l) :

::

    phc2sys[373.480]: eth4 phc offset       -14 s2 freq   -8311
    phc2sys[373.500]: eth1 phc offset       -18 s2 freq   -8315

Start an AM57xx OC in slave only mode connected to a BC's master port,
for example, the AM572x OC-3 in the `sample
setup <#sample-bc-setups>`__. To make sure the OC is started in slave
only mode, the ptp4l command

::

    $ ptp4l -2 -P -f oc.cfg -s -m

can be used. The slave OC's PPS can then be measured against the
reference PTP master clock's PPS.

.. rubric:: Forcing BC Port State Change (for Testing Purpose)
   :name: forcing-bc-port-state-change-for-testing-purpose

To force a port state change on the BC ports for testing purpose, one
can bring down the current reference PTP master clock and bring up
another reference PTP master clock connected to, for example, the BC's
eth1 interface in the `sample setup <#sample-bc-setups>`__. Or simply
rearrange the cable connections in the `sample
setup <#sample-bc-setups>`__ as shown below.

.. Image:: /images/Bc_reconnect.jpg

See
`here <http://processors.wiki.ti.com/images/8/83/Bc_reconnect_20180112.pdf>`__
for a sample log when the BC's cables are reconnected. The sample log
starts right before when the cable is disconnected from eth2 on BC's
ICSS2 in the `sample setup <#sample-bc-setups>`__.

Limitations
-----------

-  In the current implementation, when running more than one OC, for
   example, ICSS1 OC and ICSS2 OC, only one pps can be enabled through
   command line. In this example, if ptp1 is the device for ICSS2 OC and
   ptp2 is the device for ICSS1 OC, then only one of the following will
   be allowed:

::

    echo 1 > /sys/class/ptp/ptp1/pps_enable

or

::

    echo 1 > /sys/class/ptp/ptp2/pps_enable

The same is true for other combinations. The intention is to avoid
having more than one PPS enabled when the IDK has the HW mod mentioned
in `Hardware Modifications for AM57xx IDK
BC <#hardware-modifications-for-am57xx-idk-bc>`__ and the pins are tied
together.


HSR OC TC
=========

Overview
--------

The purpose of this section and the sub-sections there in  is to provide
an overview of Linux PTP ordinary clock (OC) and transparent clock (TC)
in a HSR network, the internal mechanism of how HSR OC and TC works on
TI's AM57xx processors, required software and hardware, test setup and
procedure, and our test results. In this section boundary clock (BC) with
connections in HSR network is not considered.

PTP OC, TC in HSR Network
-------------------------

The implementation of the HSR OC and TC on AM57xx is based on the
IEEE-62439-03-2016 recommendation. Currently it supports only two-step
HSR hybrid clock (OC+TC) without BMCA enhanced for HSR. Future releases
will fill in the missing features.

Since HSR network is a ring topology network, the PTP clocks in such
networks must handle PTP messages communicated over the two slave ports
under a HSR interface. In addition to originating its own PTP messages
and receiving PTP messages, a HSR clock must also forward PTP messages,
except link local messages, for downstream nodes to process. In other
words, a PTP clock in a HSR network must either be a standalone TC or an
OC which also functions as a TC, i.e. a hybrid clock, as is defined in
IEEE-62439-03-2016.

Hardware
^^^^^^^^

On AM57xx platforms, the HSR PTP OC and TC functionalities are provided
by the ICSS-PRU hardware modules.

Software
^^^^^^^^

On the software side, the key software modules for supporting the HSR
PTP clock functionalities include the HSR firmware, PRU ethernet driver,
core HSR layer, core network layer and the application linuxptp. The
Linux kernel modules are responsible passing timestamps and HSR tag
information to application linuxptp on receive path. On transmit path,
those kernel modules are also responsible for accepting HSR tag
information (if passed in by application, for example, for delay corrected
FOLLOW-UPs that are passing through the node) and sending frames out over
a specific HSR slave port indicated by the application. Sending a PTP
message over a specified HSR slave port is needed, for example, for
FOLLOW-UP messages.

For OC functionality, other than handling the HSR tag information, the
processing of PTP messages by the application is similar to the regular
OC functionality without HSR, although the application running on a
slave OC must only allow the ACTIVE port to adjust its PTP clock.

One of the key features of a TC is the capability of being able to make
timestamp "corrections" in the FOLLOW-UP message for a SYNC message.
This is achieved as follows. When the HSR firmware receives a SYNC
message, it passes both the rx timestamp and cut-through forward tx
timestamp of the SYNC message to the host driver. These timestamps are
then passed to the application, along with the SYNC, by the kernel
drivers. With the rx timestamp and the cut-through tx timestamp of the
SYNC message, the application linuxptp can then add the residence time
delay, in addtion to the peer path delay, in the correctionField of the
SYNC's FOLLOW-UP message before the FOLLOW-UP is forwarded to next hop.

Required hardware and software to setup HSR OC, TC
--------------------------------------------------

Hardware Modifications for AM57xx IDK HSR OC, TC
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The hardware modifications needed for AM57xx IDK to function as HSR OC
and TC are the same as those required for regular OC and BC. These
modifications are for PPS generation on the AM57xx IDK.

AM571x
~~~~~~

See the `AM571x Mod
List <http://processors.wiki.ti.com/images/3/34/Am571x_idk_pps_ModList.pdf>`_
for more details of the hardware modification specification. Sample assembly photos can
be found `here <http://processors.wiki.ti.com/images/9/9d/IDK-Mods-AM571x-v2.2c.pdf>`_

AM572x and AM574x
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See the `AM572x/AM574x Mod
List <http://processors.wiki.ti.com/images/2/2f/Am572x_am574x_idk_pps_ModList.pdf>`_
for more details of the hardware modification specification.

Software
^^^^^^^^

AM57xx HSR OC and TC are supported with limitations in ProcessorSDK
Linux release starting from version 4.3.0.6. See the section
`Limitations <#Limitations>`_ below for more details.

**Remark** Because PPS needs to be enabled in PTP tests, so the
devicetree (dtb) needs to be loaded when booting the kernel must contain
the PPS configurations. But by default, after **make Linux\_install**,
the default devicetree is not the right one for enabling PPS:

::

    $ ls -l /rel4306/rootfs/boot/am571x-idk.dtb
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 user user32 Apr 20 22:54 /rel4306/rootfs/boot/am571x-idk.dtb -> devicetree-uImage-am571x-idk.dtb

The correct dtb needed for enabling pps is

::

    $ ls -l /rel4306/rootfs/boot/am571x-idk-pps.dtb
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 user user 36 Apr 20 22:54 /rel4306/rootfs/boot/am571x-idk-pps.dtb -> devicetree-uImage-am571x-idk-pps.dtb

For PTP tests, the default dtb **am571x-idk.dtb** needs to be replaced
by **am571x-idk-pps.dtb** when creating the SDCard for kernel bootup.

One way to do that is, for example, in the boot directory overwrite the
default dtb by the pps dtb

::

    $ cd /rel4306/rootfs/boot/
    $ rm am571x-idk.dtb
    $ cp am571x-idk-pps.dtb  am571x-idk.dtb

And then follow the usual steps to create the SDCard.

Similarly for AM572x.

Test Setup/Procedure
--------------------

Test 1. With a hybrid clock (OC+TC) between master and slave clock
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A Sample 3 HSR Hybrid Clock Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. Image:: /images/3clock.jpg

Although each clock in this setup is a HSR hybrid clock, the role that
each clock plays in this test is as follows:

::

    DUT-2 : AM572x : Master clock
    DUT-1 : AM571x : Transparent clock
    DUT-3 : AM572x : Slave clock

.. note:: In this release BMCA enhanced for HSR is not supported, hence the connection is not a HSR close-loop network.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

The script file :ref:`setup-hsr` and clock configuration files e.g.
dut_1_hsr_oc.cfg, dut_2_hsr_oc.cfg, dut_3_hsr_oc.cfg (each identical, same as
listed in `PTP Redundancy <Industrial_Protocols_PTP.html#redundancy-hsr-prp>`__
section for HSR) will be used in the setup of the tests.

-  For each DUT-X, copy the setup script setup\_hsr.sh and the clock
   configuration file dut\_X\_hsr\_oc.cfg into the target filesystem of
   DUT-X. For the sample setup above

::

    DUT-2 : setup_hsr.sh : dut_2_hsr_oc.cfg
    DUT-1 : setup_hsr.sh : dut_1_hsr_oc.cfg
    DUT-3 : setup_hsr.sh : dut_3_hsr_oc.cfg

-  Connect the 3 AM57xx IDKs as shown above.

-  Boot IDK into u-boot prompt and to specify HSR firmware is to be
   loaded, do

::

    $ setenv pruss1_ethtype 1
    $ setenv pruss2_ethtype 1
    $ saveenv

-  Boot IDK into kernel prompt.

-  Modify the top fields in `setup\_hsr.sh <http://processors.wiki.ti.com/images/1/18/Setup_hsr.pdf>`__
   to reflect the HSR slave
   ports' MAC addresses and IP address of the DUT's HSR interface. The
   **ETHA** or **ETHB** fields may also need to be modified if an ICSS
   different from the one shown in the picture is used.

-  Run the modified setup\_hsr.sh script to configure the hsr0
   interface.

-  After each IDK is bootup, do a ping to make sure the setup is fine.

-  On DUT-2 (master OC) do

::

    $ ptp4l -2 -P -f dut_2_hsr_oc.cfg -m

-  On DUT-1 (OC+TC) do

::

    $ ptp4l -2 -P -f dut_1_hsr_oc.cfg -m -s

-  On DUT-3 (slave OC) do:

::

    $ ptp4l -2 -P -f dut_3_hsr_oc.cfg -m -s

-  Open a telnet terminal to DUT-2 and enable PPS:

::

    $ echo 1 > /sys/class/ptp/ptp1/pps_enable

-  Open a telnet terminal to DUT-3 and enable PPS:

::

    $ echo 1 > /sys/class/ptp/ptp1/pps_enable

-  Measure PPS jitter between DUT-2 (master) and DUT-3 (slave)

-  See sample capture files
   `dut\_1\_log.txt <http://processors.wiki.ti.com/images/7/77/Dut_1.pdf>`_,
   `dut\_2\_log.txt <http://processors.wiki.ti.com/images/e/ea/Dut_2.pdf>`_,

   for more detail.

**Remark:** When enabling the ICSS2 PPS, the ptpX entry associated with
ICSS2 on DUT-2 and DUT-3 may be different on different setups. Run the
script
`ptpinfo.sh <http://processors.wiki.ti.com/images/2/24/Ptpinfo.pdf>`_
to find out the correct ptpX entry that is associated with ICSS2 on each
platform.

From the sample display of the ptpinfo.sh script below, the ptpX entry
associated with ICSS2 (PRUSS2 timer) is ptp1.
