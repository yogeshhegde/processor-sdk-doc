   :name: introduction

DWC3 is a SuperSpeed (SS) USB 3.0 Dual-Role-Device (DRD) from Synopsys.

Main features of DWC3:

The SuperSpeed USB controller features:

-  Dual-role device (DRD) capability:
-  Same programming model for SuperSpeed (SS), High-Speed (HS),
   Full-Speed (FS), and Low-Speed (LS)
-  Internal DMA controller
-  LPM protocol in USB 2.0 and U0, U1, U2, and U3 states for USB 3.0

.. rubric:: **TI SoC Integration**
   :name: ti-soc-integration

DWC3 is integrated in OMAP5, DRA7x and AM437x SoCs from TI.

.. rubric:: OMAP5 (omap5-uevm)
   :name: omap5-omap5-uevm

The following diagram depicts dwc3 integration in OMAP5. The ID and VBUS
events are sensed by a companion device (palmas). The palmas-usb driver
(drivers/extcon/extcon-palmas.c) notifies the events to OMAP glue driver
(driver/usb/dwc3/dwc3-omap.c) via the extcon framework. The glue driver
writes the events to the software mailbox present in DWC3 glue (SS USB
OTG controller  module in the diagram) which interrupts the core using
UTMI+ signals.

|DWC3 integration in OMAP5|

.. rubric:: DRA7x/AM57x
   :name: dra7xam57x

The above diagram also depicts dwc3 integration in DRA7x/AM57x. Some
boards provide VBUS and ID events over GPIO whereas some provide ID over
GPIO and VBUS through Power Management IC (palmas).

-  DRA7-evm (J6-evm) and DRA72-evm (J6-eco) boards have ID detection but
   no VBUS detection support. ID detection is provided through GPIO
   expander (PCF8574).
-  DRA71-evm (J6entry-evm) board has VBUS and ID detection support. Both
   ID and VBUS detection are provided through GPIO expander (PCF8574).

On these boards, the GPIO driver (drivers/extcon/extcon-usb-gpio.c)
notifies the ID and VBUS events to the OMAP dwc3 glue
(drivers/usb/dwc3/dwc3-omap.c) via the extcon framework.

All DRA7x boards use USB1 port as Super-Speed dual-role port and USB2
port High-Speed Host port (Type mini-A). You will need a mini-A to
Type-A adapter to use the Host port.

.. rubric:: AM57x (BeagleBoard-x15/AM57xx-evm/AM57xx-IDK)
   :name: am57x-beagleboard-x15am57xx-evmam57xx-idk

-  BeagleBoard-x15/AM57xx-evm use USB1 as Super-Speed host port and have
   a on-board Super-Speed hub which provides 3 Super-Speed Host (Type-A)
   ports. USB2 is used as High-Speed peripheral port. VBUS detection for
   USB2 port is provided through Power Management IC (palmas). The
   palmas USB driver (drivers/extcon/extcon-palmas.c) notifies the VBUS
   event to the OMAP dwc3 glue (drivers/usb/dwc3/dwc3-omap.c) via the
   extcon framework.

-  AM57xx-IDK boards use USB1 as a High-Speed Host port (Type-A) and
   USB2 as a High-Speed dual-role port. ID detection for USB2 is
   provided via GPIO whereas VBUS detection is provided through the PMIC
   (palmas). The palmas USB driver (drivers/extcon/extcon-palmas.c)
   notifies both VBUS and ID events to the OMAP dwc3 glue
   (drivers/usb/dwc3/dwc3-omap.c) via the extcon framework.

.. rubric:: AM437x
   :name: am437x

The following diagram depicts dwc3 integration in AM437x. Super-Speed is
not supported so maximum speed is high-speed. VBUS and ID detection is
done by the internal PHY, so companion device is not needed. DWC3
controller uses HW UTMI mode to get the VBUS and ID events and the glue
driver (omap-dwc3.c) does not need to write to the software mailbox to
notify the events to the dwc3 core.

-  On AM437x-gp-evm, AM437x-epos-evm and AM437x-sk-evm, USB0 port is
   used as dual-role port and USB1 port is used as Host port (Type-A).

.. rubric:: OMAP5-uevm
   :name: omap5-uevm

OMAP5-evm has a single Super-Speed micro AB port provided by the DWC3
controller. To use it in host mode a OTG adapter (Micro USB 3.0 9-Pin
Male to USB 3.0 Female OTG Cable) like below should be used. The ID pin
within the adapter must be grounded. Some of the adapters available in
the market don't have ID pin grounded. If the ID pin is not grounded the
dual-role port will not switch from peripheral mode to host mode.

|OMAP5-HOST.jpg|

.. rubric:: DRA7x-evm
   :name: dra7x-evm

DRA7x-evm has 2 USB ports provided by the DWC3 controllers. USB1 is a
Super-Speed port and USB2 is a High-Speed port. USB1 is by default
configured in dual-role mode and USB2 is configured in host mode.

For connecting a device to the USB2 port use a mini-A to Type-A OTG
adapter cable like this. The ID pin within the adapter cable must be
grounded.

|Dra7-HOST.jpg|

For using the USB1 port in host mode use a Super-Speed OTG adapter cable
similar to the one used in OMAP5.

.. rubric:: AM437x
   :name: am437x-1

AM437x has two USB ports. USB0 is a host port and USB1 is a dual-role
port.

The USB0 host port has a standard A female so no special cables needed.
To use the USB1 port in host mode a micro OTG adapter cable is required
like below.

   :name: mass-storage-gadget

In gadget mode standard USB cables with micro plug should be used.

Example: To use ramdisk as a backing store use the following

::

    # mkdir /mnt/ramdrive
    # mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /mnt/ramdrive -o size=600M
    # dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/ramdrive/vfat-file bs=1M count=600
    # mkfs.ext2 -F /mnt/ramdrive/vfat-file
    # modprobe g_mass_storage file=/mnt/ramdrive/vfat-file

In order to see all other options supported by g\_mass\_storage, just
run modinfo command:

**Note:** The `USB Mass Storage
Specification <http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/devclass_docs/>`__
requires us to pass a valid iSerialNumber of 12 alphanumeric digits,
however g\_mass\_storage will not generate one because the Kernel has no
way of generating a stable and valid Serial Number. If you want to pass
USB20CV and USB30CV MSC tests, pass a valid iSerialNumber argument.

.. rubric:: USB 2.0 Test Modes
   :name: usb-2.0-test-modes

The `Universal Serial Bus 2.0
Specification <http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/usb20_docs/usb_20_081114.zip>`__
defines a set of Test Modes used to validate electrical quality of Data
Lines pair (D+/D-). There are two ways of entering these Test Modes with
*DWC3*.

-  Sending properly formatted SetFeature(TEST) Requests to the device
   (see `USB2.0
   spec <http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/usb20_docs/usb_20_081114.zip>`__
   for details)

This is the preferred (and Standard) way of entering USB 2.0 Test Modes.
However, it's not always that we will have a functioning USB Host to
issue such requests.

-  Using a *non-standard*
   `DebugFS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugfs>`__ interface (see
   below for details)

Any time we don't have a functioning Host on the Test Setup and still
want to enter USB 2.0 Test Modes, we can use this `non-standard
interface </index.php/Linux_Core_DWC3_User%27s_Guide#Non-Standard_DebugFS_Interface>`__
for that purpose. One such use-case is for low level USB 2.0 Eye Diagram
testing where the DUT (Device Under Test) is connected to an
oscilloscope through a test fixture.

.. rubric:: Non-Standard DebugFS Interface
   :name: non-standard-debugfs-interface

DWC3 Driver exposes a few testing and development tools through the
`Debug File System <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugfs>`__. In order
to use it, you must first mount that file system in case it's not
mounted yet. Below, we show an example session on AM437x.

::

    # mount -t debugfs none /sys/kernel/debug
    # cd /sys/kernel/debug
    # ls

Note the two directories terminated with *.usb*. Those are the two
instances available on AM437x devices, 48390000.usb is USB1 and
483d0000.usb is USB2. Both of those directories contain the same thing,
we will use 48390000.usb for the purposes of illustration.

A better use for this is, if you know the register name you're looking
for, by using *grep* we can reduce the amount of output. Assuming we
want to check register DCTL we could:

::

    # grep DCTL regdump 
    DCTL = 0x8c000000

.. rubric:: testmode
   :name: testmode

Shows current USB 2.0 Test Mode. Can also be used to enter such test
modes in situations where we can't issue proper SetFeature(TEST)
requests. Available options are *test\_j*, *test\_k*, *test\_se0\_nak*,
*test\_packet*, *test\_force\_enable*. The only way to exit the test
modes is through a USB Reset.

::

    # cat testmode 
    no test
    # echo test_packet > testmode 
    # cat testmode 
    test_packet
