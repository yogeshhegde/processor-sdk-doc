Linux Board Port
================

Overview
--------
This document describes how to conduct a Linux Board Port on an
AM335x-type custom board. This process will first start with a base
Board Port using a **hello_world.dts** file, which can then be 
iteratively changed to add needed peripherals.

This tutorial assumes the latest `TI SDK
<https://software-dl.ti.com/processor-sdk-linux/esd/AM335X/latest/index_FDS.html>`__ 
has been installed, and a host machine has been properly configured.

This tutorial also recommends using TI's `hello_world.dts <git.ti.com>`__ file.

.. note:: This document outlines steps to conduct a basic Linux Board Port based
   on a BeagleBone Black (AM335x), but can be adapted to fit any board.

.. note:: To assist with the port abstraction there is a processor DTSI file that
   contains node definitions for describing the SOC itself as well as all the
   peripherals of the selected processor. The DTSI is used as an include file for a
   custom board DTS file. Typically these DTSI files should be used as is and
   should not be edited. The main reason is that TI may make peripheral node
   definition changes during development of an SDK release.  

Creating an initial baseline "Hello World" Device Tree Source file
------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to conduct a Linux Board Port on a custom board, we must first create
an initial baseline to build up from. Once this baseline has been created, we can
iteratively add the peripherals necessary for our custom board by including the
Device Tree Source file produced by the Pin Mux Tool in our **hello_world.dts**
file.

.. note:: Although it is possible to use a full board DTS from the start, it is
   recommended to start from the **hello_world.dts** file to differentiate between
   issues related to hardware, and issues related to the DTS file. Starting from a
   known working **hello_world.dts** and adding to it is much simpler to debug.
   Because this guide is based on a TI EVM, it is also recommended to bring up
   this **hello_world.dts** on a TI EVM.

* Creating a minimal **pinmux.dtsi** file

   #. Install and open `TI's Pin Mux Tool <http://www.ti.com/tool/PINMUXTOOL>`__, which is
      available in either Windows, Linux, or Cloud formats

      .. note:: More information about using the Pin Mux Tool can be found on TI's
         `Processor SDK Documentation
         <../../Foundational_Components/Tools/Pin_Mux_Tools.html>`__.

   #. Select your device and package

   #. Add a MMC device and set configurations like below:

      .. Image:: /images/Linux_board_port_img3.png

   #. Add a UART device and set configurations like below:

      .. Image:: /images/Linux_board_port_img4.png

   #. Export the Pin Mux Tool's generated DTSI file as **pinmux.dtsi**

   #. Delete all "Optional sleep pin settings" sections from **pinmux.dtsi**
      unless necessary. If sleep pin settings are needed, values must be entered
      manually into **pinmux.dtsi**

   #. Copy **pinmux.dtsi** to
      **<PROCESSOR-SDK>/board-support/linux-x.xx.xx+gitAUTOINC+be5389fd85-gbe5389fd85/arch/arm/boot/dts/**

   .. note:: MMC and UART are the minimum devices necessary to conduct a minimal
      Linux board port. More peripherals can be added iteratively in the next section. 

   .. note:: Binding peripherals is very important to a successful Linux board
      port. The included hello_world.dts file has already binded the MMC and UART
      devices, but binding must be done for each peripheral. Common Bindings
      can be found `here
      <https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/>`__

* Building and adding **hello_world.dts** to SDK Kernel tree directory

   #. Add the line ``#include pinmux.dtsi`` after ``#include processor.dtsi`` to
      **hello_world.dts**

   #. Navigate to top-level kernel tree in SDK
      **<PROCESSOR-SDK>/board-support/linux-x.xx.xx+gitAUTOINC+be5389fd85-gbe5389fd85**

   #. Copy included **hello_world.dts** file to
      **<PROCESSOR-SDK>/board-support/linux-x.xx.xx+gitAUTOINC+be5389fd85-gbe5389fd85/arch/arm/boot/dts/**

   #. Add **hello_world.dtb** associated with out new **hello_world.dts** file to
      the make system by editing **arch/arm/boot/dts/Makefile**. Make sure to
      place it in the correct config section. For this example, this line would
      be placed under the ``dtb-$(CONFIG_SOC_AM33XX)`` block:

      .. Image:: /images/Linux_board_port_img1.png

   #. Build **hello_world.dts**:

      ::

         make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE='arm-linux-gnueabihf-' mrproper
         make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE='arm-linux-gnueabihf-' tisdk_am335x-evm_defconfig
         make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE='arm-linux-gnueabihf-' dtbs

* Test the minimal Hello World Linux Board Port

   #. Create a bootable SD card by following the steps outlined in the `Linux SD
      Card Creation Guide
      <../../Overview/Processor_SDK_Linux_create_SD_card_script.html>`__. It is
      recommended to follow the steps to create a "SD Card Using Default Images."

   #. Make a copy of the **am335x-boneblack.dtb** file in the SD card root file
      system:

      ::

         sudo mv /media/<USER>/rootfs/boot/am335x-boneblack.dtb
         /media/<USER>/rootfs/boot/am335x-boneblack.dts-orig

   #. Copy the newly built **hello_world.dtb** file into the **rootfs/boot**
      directory of the SD card as **am335x-boneblack.dtb**:

      ::

         sudo cp <PATH-TO-FILE>/hello_world.dtb /media/<USER>/rootfs/boot/am335x-boneblack.dtb
      
      .. note:: Replacing the **am335x-boneblack.dtb** with our own
         **hello_world.dtb** file will allow us to use the prebuilt U-Boot and
	 reduce our workload. Until our custom board ID has been flashed into
         the EEPROM, using the default BeagleBone Black ID will suffice. 

   #. Connect board to serial port via FTDI Cable and boot it from the new SD
      Card

   #. If the minimal Linux board port was successful, the following "Hello World"
      message should appear:

Iteratively Building the PinMux for Custom Board
------------------------------------------------
Now that a minimal "Hello World" Linux board port has been completed in the
previous steps, we can now start customizing our board by adding support for the
board's peripherals. We can do this by iteratively adding peripherals one by one
to the Device Tree Source. Doing this process iteratively will save time
by reducing the number of devices that need to be debugged at once.

To customize your board, the PinMux on your processor needs to be set for your
board's peripherals. TI's Pin Mux Tool provides a graphical user interface
for selecting the peripheral interfaces that will be used in the system design.
Its intelligent solver automatically selects pin combinations that help the
designer make sure there are no multiplexing conflicts.

#. Open project from previous steps on `TI's Pin Mux Tool 
   <http://www.ti.com/tool/PINMUXTOOL>`__

#. Add next peripheral needed for your custom board  

#. Export the DTSI file produced by the Pin Mux Tool under the name
   **pinmux.dtsi**. This file will be included in your custom board's
   **hello_world.dts** file to provide functionality for all of its peripherals 

#. Copy **pinmux.dtsi** to
   **<PROCESSOR-SDK>/board-support/linux-x.xx.xx+gitAUTOINC+be5389fd85-gbe5389fd85/arch/arm/boot/dts/**

#. Bind new peripheral to board in **hello_world.dts**. Common Bindings
   can be found `here <https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/>`__

#. Rebuild **hello_world.dts** to incorporate the new **pinmux.dtsi** file:

   ::

      make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE='arm-linux-gnueabihf-' dtbs

#. Connect bootable SD card to Linux host and Copy the newly built
   **hello_world.dtb** file into the **rootfs/boot** directory of the SD card as
   **am335x-boneblack.dtb**:

   ::

      sudo cp <PATH-TO-FILE>/hello_world.dtb /media/<USER>/rootfs/boot/am335x-boneblack.dtb

   .. note: Make sure an original copy of the SDK **am335x-boneblack.dtb** file
      has already been copied to **am335x-boneblack.dtb-orig** to avoid loss of work.

#. Connect board to serial port via FTDI Cable and boot it from the new SD
   Card

#. Correct any errors due to the new peripheral added to **pinmux.dtsi**

#. Repeat these steps by adding remaining peripherals to **pinmux.dtsi** one by one
   using the Pin Mux Tool

Suggested Tips
--------------
* More information about Linux Board Porting can be found in this `Linux Board
  Port Elements presentation
  <https://training.ti.com/sites/default/files/docs/linux_board_port_elements.pdf>`__
* The "Hello World" message can be deleted from **hello_world.dts** once
  customization and debugging is complete. It is recommended to keep this message
  until debugging is fully complete to help show if the board port was still successful
  after changing the **pinmux.dtsi** file. 
* Because this guide is based on a TI EVM, it is suggested to bring up the
  **hello_world.dts** on a TI EVM initally.
* Always try to use the `TI Pin Mux Tool <http://www.ti.com/tool/PINMUXTOOL>`__
  when adding peripherals. This will limit syntactical errors.
