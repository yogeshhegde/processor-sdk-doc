.. rubric:: Installation and Usage
   :name: installation-and-usage

The `Software Developer's Guide <index.html>`__ provides instructions on how to setup up your Linux development
environment, install the SDK and start your development.  It also includes User's Guides for various Example Applications and Code
Composer Studio.

|

.. rubric:: Host Support
   :name: host-support

The Processor SDK is developed, built and verified on Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04. Details on how to create a virtual machine to load Ubuntu
are described in `this page <How_to_Guides/Host/How_to_Build_a_Ubuntu_Linux_host_under_VMware.html>`__.


.. note::
   Processor SDK Installer is 64-bit, and installs only on 64-bit host
   machine. Support for 32-bit host is dropped as Linaro toolchain is
   available only for 64-bit machines
