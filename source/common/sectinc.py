#
# Parameters: app               - Application calling this Python function
#             family_configlist - Device family Table-of-Contents file input
#             verbosity         - Flag to determine if function will print names for all
#                                 documents that are to be included

# set_excluded_docs
# -----------------
#
# Description:  For each toctreesection in the master list, searches the docs_to_keep[] array

#               is not found, it is placed in the exclusion_list so that Sphinx does not build it.
#
# Parameters: app            - Application calling this Python function
#             exclusion_list - Section (.rst file) exclusion list used by Sphinx build

# ------------------

# Parameters: app   - Application calling this Python function

#                     documentation source

# ------------------

#
# Parameters: app   - Application calling this Python function

# get_toctree_entries
# -------------------
#
# Description:  This function opens a toctreenodefile that contains a "toctree" directive within it.
# It searches for the "toctree" directive. After finding the toctree directive, it searches
# for the next blank line (since this blank line is required for toctree's to work
# in restructured text).  It then reads each line into toctreesections[] until it encounters
# another blank line.
#
# Limitations:  In the current implementation, the assumption is that only a single toctree directive
# is in each file.  This code would need to be updated if more than one toctree directive
# is found in a single file.
#
# Parameters: app             - Application calling this Python function
#             toctreenodefile - An .rst file that contains a toctree directive
#             op_os           - Operating System for the SDK (i.e. source/{op_os} for the
#                               documentation source

# create_master_rst_list
# ----------------------
#
# Description:  This function first recursively searches for all files in source/{op_os} folder
# that contain "toctree" directives, and places the names of these files in toctreefiles[].
# Second, it recursively searches in this same directory for all .rst files and places the
# names of these files in all_rst_files[].
# Lastly, it gathers the toctreesections[] across all the toctreefiles[].
# The result of this function is a master list (in toctreesections[]) of all .rst files
# that the Table of Contents stage of the Sphinx build could utilize.
#
# Parameters: app   - Application calling this Python function
#             op_os - Operating System for the SDK (i.e. source/{op_os} for the documentation source
#                     Currently only tested on "linux", but should be able to be used on
#                     android or rtos.
