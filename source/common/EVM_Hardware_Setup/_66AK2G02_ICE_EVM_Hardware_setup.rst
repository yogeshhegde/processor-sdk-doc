Supported JTAG Debug Probes (Emulators)
---------------------------------------------


-  XDS100-class JTAG debug probes (low cost, low performance). The XDS100v1 is not supported.
-  XDS200-class JTAG debug probes (recommended)
-  XDS560v2-class JTAG debug probes (high performance)


Minimal EVM setup
-------------------

Setting Boot Switches
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The DIP switch (SW3) is used for selecting the boot
mode.

**For the EVM Out-of-Box experience, use SD/MMC boot mode as shown in the image below**:

.. Image:: ../../../images/K2GICE_Boot_MODE.png
	:scale: 50%

|

The table below lists all of the boot modes supported on the ICE EVM.

	:scale: 50%

Connecting an Emulator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. Note:: This EVM setup is only required for developers who need to connect to cores using Code Composer Studio (CCS) to load their application.


The EVM supports two types of emulation via the on-board XDS100 emulator or the 20-pin JTAG header.

When an external emulator is not connected to the 20-pin JTAG Header, the on-board
XDS100 embedded JTAG emulator is the default type of emulation (SoC JTAG
signals are routed to the XDS100 on-board emulator). When an external emulator
is connected to the 20-pin JTAG Header, it is automatically detected and the SoC
JTAG signals are routed to the external emulator.

**On-board XDS100 Emulator**

The K2G ICE EVM has on-board XDS100 embedded JTAG emulation circuitry so an external emulator is not required.
Users can connect to the target SoC via CCS by connecting the USB cable, supplied in the ICE EVM kit, as shown in the image below.

	:scale: 50%

|

**20-pin JTAG Header for Connecting an External Emulator**

Users have the option of connecting an external at the 20-pin JTAG
Header connector (EMU1). The 20-pin JTAG Header is provided on-board for
high speed real-time emulation. All JTAG and EMUxx signals are
terminated on 20-pin JTAG Header.

Powering Up the EVM
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. rubric:: Power Supply Specifications
   :name: power-supply-specifications

The K2G ICE EVM can be powered from one of two sources. A single +24V /
2.5A DC (60W) external power supply connected to the DC power jack (J6).
In addition, the K2G ICE EVM can be powered from the 12V supply pins on
the PCIE edge connector. A power ANDing circuit is included in the
design which will prevent damage if the +24V is connected while the
board is installed on a PCIE backplane. The +24V supply will supply the
power for the board in that condition.

CCS Setup
-----------

This section describes the setup to connect to 66AK2G02 ICE EVM using
Code composer Studio environment and an emulator.

There are two scenarios while connecting to the EVM :

-  **Connect to EVM without a SD card boot image to boot the EVM**
-  **Connect to EVM after booting an image from the SD card**.

.. Note:: Keystone II device support package in CCSv7.1 includes the support for K2G ICE board but CCSv7.0/ CCSv6 users may need to update the device support package as described in the section "Update CCS to Install Keystone II Device Support Package."

|

Update CCS to Install Keystone II Device Support Package
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All revisions of the board require this step to be performed in order to
get the latest GEL files and the target content for the K2G if you are
using CCSv7.0 and earlier. This step will not be required for CCS
versions higher than version 7.1. CCSv7.0 or CCSv6.1.3 package contain
KeystoneII device support package v1.1.6 which doesn't contain K2GICE
specific target files hence we recommend this update.

1. All CCS v6.1.3 or CCSv7.0 and earlier version users are
required to update the Keystone Device Support package by going into the
Help->Check For Updates

.. Image:: ../../../images/Check_for_Updates.png
	:scale: 50%

2. Select Keystone2 device support package. Follow menu options
to continue with the update.

3. After the update is complete go to Help->Installation details
and check that Keystone2 device support package v1.1.9 or later are
installed as shown below.

.. Image:: ../../../images/KeystoneII_device_support_package.png
	:scale: 50%

.. Note:: The package can be downloaded separately from the link below and manually unzipped into CCS installation.

   Files <https://software-dl.ti.com/ccs/esd/documents/ccs_device_support_files.html>`__


.. Note:: For K2G Devices, if using CCS v6.1.2 and Keystone2 device support v1.1.7, 66AK2G02 would not show up in the list of devices when creating the target configuration. This is due to an incompatibility in the XML parser in CCS v6.1.2 with the K2G device xml. In order to work-around this issue, make the change in 66AK2G02.xml as illustrated below in order to have 66AK2G02 display in the device list. This problem does not exist in CCS v6.1.3 onwards as the XML parser has been updated.

Connect without an SD Card Boot Image
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. rubric:: Configuring target configuration files
   :name: configuring-target-configuration-files

Launch CCS and create a new target configuration (File->New->Target Configuration file) as shown in the images below.

.. Image:: ../../../images/CCS_target_configuration.png
	:scale: 50%

Provide an appropriate name to the configuration. Select Spectrum Digital XDS100 emulator and target as K2G ICE EVM.

.. Note:: If you don't find the K2GICE target make sure you have installed CCSv7.1 or higher. If using CCSv 7.0 or CCSv6.1.x and earlier, ensure that you have done the software update correctly as shown in the how to section below.

.. Image:: ../../../images/K2G_ICE_target_configuration.png
	:scale: 50%

In advanced settings, make sure that the GEL files are populated correctly. The following GEL files and their corresponding cores are provided below.

-  C66X Core: icek2g.gel
-  A15 Core: icek2g\_arm.gel

.. rubric:: Connecting to target
   :name: connecting-to-target

1. Download Code composer Studio or for CCSv7.0 and earlier, ensure it contains Keystone device support package version 1.1.9 as described in the
how to guide "Update CCS to Install Keystone II Device Support Package."

2. 66AK2G02 ICE EVM contains boot switches to configure for "No boot/sleep" mode. So configure the boot switches to "No Boot Mode" as described in
the "Setting Boot Switches" section.

3. Connect an XDS100 Emulator to the XDS USB port of the ICE EVM as shown in the
section "Connecting Emulator."

4. Launch CCS and create a new target configuration as discussed in
the previous section "Configuring target configuration files."

5. Launch the newly created
target configuration.

	:scale: 50%

6. K2G can be a DSP or an ARM master boot device
so connect to the C66x or the A15\_0.

Connect with an SD Card Boot Image
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.  Launch CCS and create a new target configuration (File->New->Target
Configuration file) as shown in the images below.

.. Image:: ../../../images/CCS_target_configuration.png
	:scale: 50%

Provide an appropriate name to the configuration. Select Spectrum digital XDS100 emulator and target as 66AK2G02.

.. Note:: If you don't find the K2GICE target make sure you have installed CCSv7.1 or higher. If using CCSv 7.0 or CCSv6.1.x and earlier, ensure that you have done the software update correctly as shown in the how to section below.

.. Image:: ../../../images/K2G_GPEVM_Target_configuration_alternate.jpg
	:scale: 50%

In advanced settings, make sure that no GEL files are populated.

2. 66AK2G02 GP EVM contains boot switches to configure for "SD/MMC boot" mode. So configure the boot switches to "SD/MMC Boot" as described in
the section "Setting Boot Switches."

3. Connect an XDS100 Emulator to the XDS USB port of the GP EVM as shown in the
section "Connecting Emulator."

4. Launch CCS and create a new target configuration as discussed in the previous
section "Configuring target configuration files".

5. Launch the newly created
target configuration.

.. Image:: ../../../images/K2G_Launch_targetConfig.png
	:scale: 50%

6. K2G will boot with ARM master boot from the SD card so connect to the A15\_0. There will be no output on the console when you
connect to the core.

7. SD card boot image will typically load a secondary bootloader like u-boot that will put the DSP in reset so users will need to follow
the instructions in the guide `How to take the C66x DSP out of reset with Linux running on A15 <http://software-dl.ti.com/processor-sdk-rtos/esd/docs/latest/rtos/How_to_Guides.html#taking-the-c66x-out-of-reset-with-linux-running-on-the-arm-a15>`__

.. Note:: RTOS users do not need to follow this step as the Secondary Bootloader (SBL) will put the DSP in idle state and not in reset if there is no code running on the DSP.
