Overview
--------

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The multichannel audio serial port (McASP) functions as a
general-purpose audio serial port optimized for the needs of
multichannel audio applications. The McASP is useful for time-division
multiplexed (TDM) stream, Inter-Integrated Sound (I2S) protocols, and
intercomponent digital audio interface transmission (DIT).The
multichannel buffered serial port (McASP) peripheral allows direct
interface to other TI DSPs, codecs, and other devices in a system. The
following sub sections explain the hardware (McASP peripheral) and
software context of the McASP LLD.

The device driver exposes a set of well-defined APIs which are used by
the application layer to send and receive data via the McASP peripheral.
The driver also exposes a set of well-defined OS abstraction APIs which
are used to ensure that the driver is OS independent and portable. The
McASP driver uses the CSL McASP register layer for all McASP MMR access.
The McASP driver also interfaces with the EDMA3/UDMA library to be able to
transfer data to and from McASP peripheral and data memory.

User Interface
--------------

Driver Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The McASP driver provides a sample implementation sequence which
initializes the MCASP IP block. The McASP Device initialization API is
implemented as a sample prototype:

::

    void McaspDevice_init (void)

The function initializes all the instance specific information like base
address of instance CFG registers, FIFO address for the instance, TX and
RX CPU event numbers, TX and RX EDMA event numbers etc.

For details about individual fields of this structure, see the Doxygen
help by opening
PDK_INSTALL_DIR\Packages\ti\drv\mcasp\docs\doxygen\html\index.html.

::

     int32_t Mcasp_socGetInitCfg(uint32_t index, Mcasp_HwInfo *cfg)

The function obtains the soc configuration parameters such as interrupt
numbers, mux configuration parameters etc.

::

     int32_t Mcasp_socSetInitCfg(uint32_t index, const Mcasp_HwInfo *cfg)

The function set the soc configuration parameters such as interrupt
numbers, mux configuration parameters etc.

APIs

.. rubric:: McASP Buffer formats
   :name: mcasp-buffer-formats

The McASP driver provides various buffer formats for sending the data
to/from the audio device. The differences between these formats arise
from the way the audio samples are collected from various serializers
and their timeslots and arranged in the system's memory. This way the
application can choose to run audio processing algorithms over the data
without the need for re-arranging those data every frame. The buffer
format is provided in the **Mcasp_ChanParams.dataFormat** in the form of
**Mcasp_BufferFormat** defined in mcasp_drv.h The below section provides
an overview of the various formats. In the explanatory diagrams in each
section, McASP controller recieves samples in frame intervals denoted by
t1,t2..tn. The McASP driver collects these and arranges those samples in
the memory in various formats in to the host's System memory. We have
chosen 32 bit samples and 32-bit word addresses throughout for
simplicity.

.. rubric:: Mcasp_BufferFormat_1SER_1SLOT
   :name: mcasp_bufferformat_1ser_1slot

This is applicable if only one serializer and one timeslot is used. The
samples are ordered in the order they received or sent.

.. Image:: ../images/1SLOT_1SER.PNG

.. rubric:: Mcasp_BufferFormat_1SER_MULTISLOT_INTERLEAVED
   :name: mcasp_bufferformat_1ser_multislot_interleaved

This is applicable if multiple slots are used with one serializer. The
samples from the different timeslots are stored interleaved in the
memory as below. Different timeslots' samples are denoted by different
colors and are labelled t1,t2..tn according to the time they arrive at
the serializer.

.. Image:: ../images/1SER_MULTISLOT_INTERLEAVED.PNG

.. rubric:: Mcasp_BufferFormat_1SER_MULTISLOT_NON_INTERLEAVED
   :name: mcasp_bufferformat_1ser_multislot_non_interleaved

This is applicable if multiple slots are used with one serializer. The
samples from the different timeslots are grouped together on the basis
of the timeslot and stored in the memory as shown below. Different
timeslots' samples are denoted by different colors and are labelled
t1,t2..tn according to the time they arrive at the serializer.

.. Image:: ../images/1SER_MULTISLOT_NON_INTERLEAVED.PNG

NOTE: if the non-interleaved format is used, the Mcasp_ChanParams->
hwFifoEventDMARatio must be set to 1.

.. rubric:: Mcasp_BufferFormat_MULTISER_1SLOT_SER_INTERLEAVED
   :name: mcasp_bufferformat_multiser_1slot_ser_interleaved

This is applicable if multiple serializers are used with one time slot
is used for each of the serializers. The samples from the different
serializers are stored in the memory in interleaved fashion as shown
below Different serializers' samples are denoted by different colors and
are labelled S1,S2..Sn according to the time they arrive at the
serializer.

.. Image:: ../images/1SER_MULTISER_1SLOT_SER_INTERLEAVED_2.PNG

|

.. rubric:: Mcasp_BufferFormat_MULTISER_1SLOT_SER_NON_INTERLEAVED
   :name: mcasp_bufferformat_multiser_1slot_ser_non_interleaved

This is applicable if multiple serializers are used with one timeslots
each per serializer. The samples from the different timeslots are
grouped together on the basis of the serializer and stored in the memory
as shown below Different serializers' samples are denoted by different
colors and are labelled S1,S2..Sn according to the time they arrive at
the serializer.

.. Image:: ../images/1SER_MULTISER_1SLOT_SER_NON_INTERLEAVED.PNG

.. rubric:: Mcasp_BufferFormat_MULTISER_MULTISLOT_SEMI_INTERLEAVED_1
   :name: mcasp_bufferformat_multiser_multislot_semi_interleaved_1

This is applicable if multiple serializers are used and each serializer
containing multiple timeslots. The samples are stored in the memory
interleaved based on serializer and timeslots as shown below. In this
example, there are 3 serializers and 2 timeslots per serializers whose
samples are noted by Ln (left) and Rn (right). Different serializers'
samples are denoted by different colors.

.. Image:: ../images/1SER_MULTISER_MULTISLOT_SEMI_INTERLEAVED_1_UPDATED.PNG

.. rubric:: Mcasp_BufferFormat_MULTISER_MULTISLOT_SEMI_INTERLEAVED_2
   :name: mcasp_bufferformat_multiser_multislot_semi_interleaved_2

This is applicable if multiple serializers are used and each serializer
containing multiple timeslots. The samples are grouped based on the
serializer and within one serializer, the timeslots are interleaved as
shown below. In this example, there are 3 serializers and 2 timeslots
per serializers whose samples are noted by Ln (left) and Rn
(right).Different serializers' samples are denoted by different colors.

.. Image:: ../images/1SER_MULTISER_MULTISLOT_SEMI_INTERLEAVED_2.PNG

NOTE: if the non-interleaved format is used, the Mcasp_ChanParams->
hwFifoEventDMARatio must be set to 1.

.. rubric:: Mcasp WordBits Selection
   :name: mcasp-wordbits-selection

With all the frame formats explained above, there is an option to choose
which bits to pack from the 32-bit serializer data obtained from/to the
McASP serializer, when the word size is less than the slot size. This
option is exercised by setting the Mcasp_chanParams->wordBitsSelect to
Mcasp_wordBitsSelect_LSB/Mcasp_wordBitsSelect_MSB.

If the default Mcasp_wordBitsSelect_LSB option is selected, the LSBs are
packed in to the system memory.

Below is an example of word size = 16bits and slot size = 32 bits and
the Mcasp_wordBitsSelect_LSB option is used. On the receiving side, the
serializer holds the 32 bit data whose LSB 16 bits are picked up and
packed in to the system memory. The MSB 16 bits are ignored.

.. Image:: ../images/WordSelect_LSB.PNG

If the Mcasp_wordBitsSelect_MSB option is used, the serializer's
MSB-16bits are packed in to the system memory. The LSBs are ignored.

.. Image:: ../images/WordSelect_MSB.PNG

.. rubric:: Priming
   :name: priming

Applications using McASP driver often might send/receive one or two
transfers via McASP before sending the application data in/out of McASP
through the driver. This would internally set up transfer request queues
so that the application can seamlessly send/receive data without the
possibility of underrun. This process, a.k.a priming is used in the
example application provided with the Processor SDK. In this example two
frames are sent/received prior to submitting the application's audio
data to the McASP driver. The number of transfer requests to prime is
application dependent and some applications where there may be a lot of
delay between transfer requests, enough to cause an underrun, the
priming factor could be higher.

AudioEQ_ExampleProject
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This example demonstrates stereo audio equalizer using biquad filters.

-  Filter default configurations are:

	-  Low_Fc       = 250.0   (Low Shelf cutoff frequency in Hz)
	-  High_Fc      = 1000.0  (High Shelf cutoff frequency in Hz)
	-  Sample_Rate  = 44100.0 (Number of samples per second)
	-  Q_Factor     = 0.707   (Bandwidth of frequency that will be affected by an equalizer)
	-  Default_Gain = 0.0     (increase or decrease in audio signal strength, expressed in dB)

-  The default Gain has been set to 0, in order to suppress any noise.
   The default Gain can be changed based on the test case requirement at, ti/drv/mcasp/example/src/audioEQ.c 'defaultGain = 0.0'.

-  The filter gains can be tuned from the uart console based on the test case requirement.

Sample log for the Audio Equalizer test is shown below

.. rubric:: Introduction
   :name: introduction-1

The sample application demonstrates the use of the MCASP driver for
audio playback. The application uses McASP LLD, and programs the AIC
codec on the EVM to send and receive the audio input. The audio received
from the AIC codec is loop back-ed at the application and sent back to
the AIC codec via MCASP LLD.
