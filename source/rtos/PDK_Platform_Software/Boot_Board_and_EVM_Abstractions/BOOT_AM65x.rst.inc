Overview
^^^^^^^^^

The Secondary Bootloader (SBL) for AM65xx device initializes the execution 
environment for multi-core applications and this can be used to demonstrate 
a real world product experience. This section covers additional details 
including execution sequence, tools and additional flashing instructions.

The SBL is essentially a baremetal application, and it uses many components 
from the Processor SDK

- <PDK>/packages/ti/build : For  build infrastructure
- <PDK>/packages/ti/csl : For initialization and SoC addresses
- <PDK>/packages/ti/board : For board and usecase specific initialization
- <PDK>/packages/ti/drv/spi :  For reading applications from OSPI flashes
- <PDK>/packages/ti/drv/udma :  For reading data from boot media using DMA
- <PDK>/packages/ti/drv/mmcsd : For reading applications from MMC/SD/eMMC
- <PDK>/packages/ti/fs/fatfs : For reading files from MMC/SD/eMMC
- <PDK>/packages/ti/drv/sciclient : For communicating with DMSC sub-system
- <PDK>/packages/ti/drv/uart : For log messages
- <PDK>/packages/ti/osal : Primitives required by ti/drv components

The SBL is in turn used by the board framework to load and start diagnostics


.. rubric:: Bootloader Execution Sequence
   :name: bootloader-execution-sequence

-  **Power On Reset**
-  **ROM Bootloader (RBL)**

   -  Software pre-programmed in AM65xx ROM memory starts executing
   -  The RBL performs platform configuration and initialization.
   -  It then checks sysboot pins and chooses booting device
   -  The RBL then configures PLL and clock settings for R5, and 
      boot media like eMMC, SD/MMC, OSPI, UART, PCIe, Ethernet etc for reliable 
      boot.
   -  If no valid bootloader found on booting device, the RBL checks for next 
      booting device, based on sysboot pins
   -  It then gets image size and load address by checking the X.509 certificate that 
      is part of the bootloader image.
   -  The RBL then verifies, optionally decrypts and loads the binary to internal 
      memory at the load address specified in the X.509 certificate.
   -  Finally it resets the R5 and passes control to Secondary Bootloader(SBL) running on the R5.

-  **Secondary bootloader(SBL)**

   -  User level secondary bootloader(SBL) begins execution from internal memory. 
      It enables ATCM, starts PMU timers for profiling, initializes the MCU, 
      and sets up the stack, heap and globals. It then jumps to main().
   -  Board Initialization is done by calls to **Board_init()** API.For additional
      details refer `Processor SDK Board Support
      <http://software-dl.ti.com/processor-sdk-rtos/esd/docs/latest/rtos/Board_EVM_Abstration.html>`__.
   -  The RAT is setup. Pin MUX and UART console are setup by calling **Board_init()** API. The 
      system firmware (SYSFW) is then loaded from the boot media into the DMSC subsystem.
   -  Once the SYSFW is up and running, the rest of the initialization can be done.
   -  This includes optionally using **Board_init()** to configure PLLs, LPSCs and DDR.
   -  The SBL then loads the application from the boot media. If the image is signed, the
      application will be copied into a user specified reserved memory, and the SBL will attempt
      to verify the image by calling system firmware APIs. On HS devices, the boot proceeds 
      only if image verification passes.
   -  The SBL parses application image(s) for each of the core(s) from boot 
      media and scatter loads it to memory.
   -  Once the application is loaded, the SBL communicates with the system firmware
      to setup the clocks for the core(s) and release it from reset.
   -  The core then starts executing from application entry point.

**NOTE**

-  RBL requires boot loader (SBL) to be in a special format with the binary image 
   appended to a X.509 certificate. The certificate contains the load address, size 
   and SHA of the bootloader image.
-  For a detailed description of ROM bootloader and more information on the image 
   format expected by the RBL refer the initialization chapter in the `AM65xx Technical
   Reference Manual <http://www.ti.com/lit/pdf/spruid7>`__
-  In addition to the bootloader and application, the DMSC firmware binary is also needed
   for the SoC to complete the system boot flow.
-  The first 256 bytes of the ATCM are reserved by SBL for its use. The SBL initializes
   the ATCM with 0xFF before it uses it.
-  If the multicore application image is also signed with a X.509 certificate, the same 
   binary can be used on GP and HS devices. For information on the application's X.509 
   certificate format, please refer `Security X509 Certificate Documentation <http://downloads.
   ti.com/tisci/esd/latest/2_tisci_msgs/security/sec_cert_format.html#security-x509-certificate-documentation>`__
-  When the R5 is released from reset, it will always fetch and execute the first
   intruction from address 0x0.

.. _am655x-image-formats:

Image Formats
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**SBL format:**

To generate the a bootable image, the SBL build uses the x509CertificateGen script to
sign the sbl binary with so that the ROM Boot Loader (RBL) can parse it. The image 
format expected by the RBL has been described in detail in the Image Format Section 
of the `AM65xx Technical Reference Manual <http://www.ti.com/lit/pdf/spruid7>`__

.. note::  For HS devices, the SBL and system firmware have to be signed with the MPK.
           For an easy out-of-box experience, the Processor SDK for HS devices signs the 
           SBL and system firmware with a TI Dummy Key. Images signed with a TI dummy
           key will boot on both GP and HS boards from TI.


.. warning::  The TI Dummy Key(s) *MUST* be replaced by customers during production
              with their own Private Keys. If the TI Dummy Keys are used in a production
              system, the system will be open to security attacks.

.. warning::  While SBL and system firmware images signed with the TI Dummy Keys will work
              on both GP and HS devices, the boot time will be significantly impacted on GP
              devices. Using SBL signed by TI Dummy Keys on GP devices is only recommended 
              during the prototyping phase - when porting code developed on GP to HS devices.

**Application image format:**

Two utilities - out2rprc and multicoreImageGen are used to convert an application elf 
image(s) into an image loadable by the SBL. The structure of a multicore application 
image is provided below:

**Signed application image format:**

To convert the multicore application image into a format that can be verified,  the build flow uses 
the x509CertificateGen script to create a x509 certificate for the app image. Images that have a
x509 certificate are called signed images. Signed applications images are mandatory for HS devices,
but will work also work on GP devices.

Signed images are automatically detected by the SBL and loaded into a scratch memory area specified during
SBL build. The scratch memory area used by default is specified in `sbl_lib.mk <https://git.ti.
com/keystone-rtos/sbl/blobs/master/build/sbl_lib.mk>`__ via the flags SBL_SCRATCH_MEM_START and 
SBL_SCRATCH_MEM_SIZE. The SBL_SCRATCH_MEM* options can also be specified for custom builds to override
the defaults.

The SBL scratch memory is unavailable to applications during app load time, as the SBL is
still active. Once the SBL transfers control to the application, this memory is available for app
use - in other words SBL_SCRATCH_MEM* is available during app runtime.

For information on the application's X.509 certificate format, please refer
`Security X509 Certificate Documentation <http://downloads.ti.com/tisci/esd/latest/
2_tisci_msgs/security/sec_cert_format.html#security-x509-certificate-documentation>`__

Building the SBL and its components
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Pre-requisites to Building**

-  Set your environment using pdksetupenv.bat or pdksetupenv.sh. Refer to 
   `Processor SDK RTOS Building <http://software-dl.ti.com/processor-sdk-rtos/esd/docs/latest/rtos/index_overview.html#setup-environment>`__ for information on setting up your build environment

.. raw:: html

   <div
   style="margin: 5px; padding: 2px 10px; background-color: #ecffff; border-left: 5px solid #3399ff;">

**NOTE**

-  SBL needs openssl to build. To check if openssl is present, type the
   following at the linux or windows prompt.
::

    openssl version


-  To build on Linux, you need to have `mono <http://www.mono-project.com>`__ installed.

-  Refer `Build Dependencies <http://software-dl.ti.com/processor-sdk-rtos/esd/docs/latest/rtos/Overview.html#command>`__ for instructions on how to install these tools,
   if they are not already present on your system.


.. raw:: html

   </div>

**Compiling the SBL**

To build all the SBL components:
::

    cd <PDK>/packages/ti/boot/sbl/build
    gmake clean all (for windows)
    make clean all  (for Linux)

-  SBL image files are be located at: **<PDK>/packages/ti/boot/sbl/binary/**
-  SBL examples are located at **<PDK>/packages/ti/boot/sbl/examples/k3MulticoreApp/binary**
-  SBL lib are located at **<PDK>/packages/ti/boot/sbl/lib/**

**Compile time options for the SBL**

The SBL supports several compile time options to tweak the SBL to satisfy requirements of
ease of use, boot time and size. These can be enabled or disabled by editing `sbl/sbl_component.mk 
<http://git.ti.com/keystone-rtos/sbl/blobs/master/sbl_component.mk>`__

-  SBL_LOG_LEVEL : Controls amount of SBL logs (on the MCU UART) and system firmware logs(on WAKEUP UART). 
   Varies from 0(no logs) to  3 (all logs)
-  SBL_USE_DMA : Valid values are 0 (use CPU to access boot media) or 1 (use DMA to
   access boot media).
-  SBL_DISPLAY_PROFILE_INFO : At the end of the boot process, displays a log of timestamps
   at which different SBL profile points are hit. This is useful to see how much 
   time the SBL spends in different functions. SBL_LOG_LEVEL can significantly
   affect performance numbers.
-  SBL_ENABLE_PLL : Dials up all the PLLs calling Board_init(). Makes it easier for 
   applications as they no longer have to initialize the PLLs. However, enabling this
   significantly increases boot time and power consumption. Requires system firmware to
   be loaded.
-  SBL_ENABLE_CLOCKS : Enables all the module clocks by calling Board_init(). Makes 
   it easier for applications as they no longer have to enable clocks. 
-  SBL_ENABLE_DDR : Initializes the DDR. At the cost of boot time, this enables
   applications to run from and use DDR. SBL_ENABLE_CLOCKS and SBL_ENABLE_PLL must
   also be enabed for this to work. Enabling this option increases the boot time.
-  SBL_SKIP_MCU_RESET : Jumps to the MCU0 application entry point
   without resetting the core. Enables faster boot time. Will not change the MCU's
   mode (lock-step/split). Application also inherits the MCU state as the SBL
   left it in.
   

The SBL also supports a "custom" build, in addition to standard out-of-box builds.
A custom build is a useful way of testing out the effect of different build options - 
like when optimizing for boot time, or enabling custom usecases like eXecute In Place (XIP)
to reduce memory usage.

For an example of how to use such custom builds, please refer to `sbl/sbl_component.mk 
<https://git.ti.com/keystone-rtos/sbl/blobs/master/sbl_component.mk#line426>`__. It shows
how to specify a select list of build options while building SBL images and libs.

.. _am655x-compiling-apps-for-sbl:

**Compiling apps that can be loaded by SBL:**

**Memory Map Considerations**

Applications that the SBL loads must comply with the am655x-sbl-memory-usage_. 
In the application's linker command file, care must be taken to not use the first
0x100 bytes of any R5 MCU's ATCM memory and SBL reserved memory from 0x41C00100 
to 0x41C3E000. If the applications are signed, no loadable sections must be placed
in the SBL scratch memory area. The scratch memory can be used at application runtime
for stacks, heaps, etc.

.. raw:: html

   <div
   style="margin: 5px; padding: 2px 10px; background-color: #ecffff; border-left: 5px solid #3399ff;">

**NOTE**

-  The local address 0x0 of the MPU is not accessible from the MCU, so any MPU linker 
   command file must not specify any loadable sections in that memory region. The SBL
   will not be able to access that memory to load code or data.


.. raw:: html

   </div>

**Converting ELF executables to SBL loadable image**

Depending on the usecase, an ELF application executable can be converted into an 
image that can be loaded by SBL in many ways.

-  **Using CCS**: Any project created using the pdkProjectCreate scripts will 
   automatically generate a SBL loadable app, as part of a post-build step.

-  **Using makefiles**: Add the following lines to the component's .mk file
::

    app_name_SBL_APPIMAGEGEN = yes
    export app_name_SBL_APPIMAGEGEN

-  **Existing ELF executable**: By calling the K3ImageGen script.
::

-  **Multicore Images**: Multicore images, as the name suggests, allows the SBL 
   to load applications for multiple cores from a single image. Creating such images
   invloves three steps.
#. Generate the ELF application executables for individual cores
#. Convert the ELF executables into intermediate .rprc images
#. Combine the .rprc images of individual cores to create a single multicore image

To covert any .out into the intermediate .rprc format, execute the following commands
::

    For Linux:
    mono <PDK>/packages/ti/boot/sbl/tools/out2rprc/bin/out2rprc.exe input.out output.rprc
::

    For Windows:
    <PDK>\packages\ti\boot\sbl\tools\out2rprc\bin\out2rprc.exe input.out output.rprc

To stitch multiple .rprc images into a multicore image, execute the following command
::

    For Linux:
    <PDK>/packages/ti/boot/sbl/tools/multicoreImageGen/bin/MulticoreImageGen LE 55 output.appimage  <core_id_1> core_1.rprc <core_id_2> core_2.rprc

::

    For Windows:
    <PDK>/packages/ti/boot/sbl/tools/multicoreImageGen/bin/MulticoreImageGen.exe LE 55 output.appimage  <core_id_1> core_1.rprc <core_id_2> core_2.rprc

   <div
   style="margin: 5px; padding: 2px 10px; background-color: #ecffff; border-left: 5px solid #3399ff;">

**NOTE**

-  The linux host environment needs to have `mono <http://www.mono-project.com>`__ installed.
-  The values used for the Core ID and Device ID can be found in `sbl/soc/k3/
   sbl_slave_core_boot.h <http://git.ti.com/keystone-rtos/sbl/blobs/master/soc/k3/sbl_slave_core_boot.h#line51>`__
-  To simply load an ELF without executing it, use CoreID value ONLY_LOAD_ID
-  If an image for MCU_1 core is provided, the SBL will attempt to switch to 
   split mode. 
-  If only an image for MCU_0 is provided, the SBL will not change the mode of the
   MCU subsystem.
-  To enable SMP on the MPU, ie, to get multiple MPUs execute from a single binary
   from the same address, use one of the following core_ids

   -  MPU1_SMP_ID: The same app binary runs on both cores in MPU cluster 1
   -  MPU2_SMP_ID: The same app binary runs on both cores in MPU cluster 2
   -  MPU_SMP_ID:  The same app binary runs all the MPUs

**Converting ELF executables to executable binary images**

Sometimes, for exteremely constrained and specialized usecases like ultra-low-latency boot 
or DDR-less systems, an ELF application executable can be converted into a binary 
image that can executed directly from the boot media, without loading into internal
memory.

As internal memory is always accessible, this mode of execution allows some otherwise
mandatory steps steps like DDR initlization or clock initialization  to be done
later or skipped altogether.

Working with such highly contrained systems require some special steps..

-  Make sure that the boot media supports eXecuting In Place (XIP).
   
-  Use the custom SBL build to select the build options to build a SBL 
   that meets the usecase requirements.

-  In the linker command file for the application, make sure that all the data 
   sections, stacks, heaps and globals are in internal read/write memory
   
-  In the linker command file for the application, make sure that there are no 
   holes in the loadable sections. Such non-contiguous sections can drastically
   blow up the binary image size, when comapred to the ELF executable size.

-  To generate an executable binary image from the applications ELF file,
   add the following lines to the component's .mk file
::

    app_name_SBL_APP_BINIMAGEGEN = yes
    export app_name_SBL_APP_BINIMAGEGEN


Testing the SBL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

SBL provides test applications to demonstrate booting the A53 and R5 cores in 
both symmetric/lock step & asymmetric/split-mode and other features. The multicore 
sample application prints a message on the UART for each core. The functionality 
the different tests exercises are listed below.

-  sbl_*_boot_test_*_all_coresTestApp_release: A single multicore boot test case 
   that boots each core in the SoC with a separate app. Also tests DDR loading
-  sbl_*_boot_test_*_xxxx_xTestApp_release.appimage: A simple testcase for booting
   core xxxx_x (eg. MCU1_0, MPU2_0 etc.)
-  sbl_*_smp_test_*_all_coresTestApp_release.appimage: A single SMP boot test case 
   that boots MCUs in lock step. The MCU app then uses the SBL lib to boot all the
   MPUs in SMP mode, ie, all the MPUs execute a single binary from the same address.
-  sbl_baremetal_boot_perf_*_mcu1_0TestApp_release.appimage: A single MCU1_0 test
   case that can be used to measure the effect of enabling/disabling the perf.
   tuning knobs in the SBL for OSPI boot. The size of the test case can be easily 
   modified by changing the value of SIZE_OF_PAD in `sbl/example/k3MulticoreApp/
   sbl_mcu_0_boot_perf_benchmark.c <http://git.ti.com/keystone-rtos/sbl/blobs/master/example/k3MulticoreApp/sbl_mcu_0_boot_perf_benchmark.c#line90>`__
   to profile for different app image sizes.
-  sbl_baremetal_boot_xip_test_am65xx_evm_mcu1_0TestApp_release.xer5f.bin: A testcase
   demonstrating booting an XIP application from OSPI flash. Please refer `sbl/build/
   sbl_mcu0_boot_xip_test.mk <https://git.ti.com/keystone-rtos/sbl/blobs/master/build/
   sbl_mcu0_boot_xip_test.mk>`__ and `sbl/example/k3MulticoreApp/mcuXiplinker.lds
   <https://git.ti.com/keystone-rtos/sbl/blobs/master/example/k3MulticoreApp/mcuXiplinker.lds>`__ 
   to see how to convert an existing application into an XIP application. The
   sbl_*_xip_entry_*.appimage works in tandem with sbl_*xip_test_*.xer5f.bin to transition
   the system from non-xip to xip boot, as the ROM, by default, does not support XIP from 
   boot media. After programming the sbl and syfw, to program  both sbl_*_xip_entry_*.appimage 
   and  sbl_*xip_test_*.xer5f.bin into OSPI flash, use the following uniflash commands

::

    For Windows:
    .\dslite.bat --mode processors -c COM9 -f <PDK>\packages\ti\boot\sbl\example\k3MulticoreApp\binary\am65xx\sbl_baremetal_boot_xip_entry_am65xx_evm_mcu1_0TestApp_release.appimage -d 3 -o A0000

**Booting Via SD Card**

#. Preparing the SD card.
#. Booting the testcase from SD card.

**Preparing the SD card**

#. To boot the target the SD card should be bootable. Follow the steps
   at `Creating bootable SD card in
   windows <http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Processor_SDK_RTOS_Creating_a_SD_Card_with_Windows>`__
   or `Creating bootable SD card in
   Linux <http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Processor_SDK_RTOS_create_SD_card_script>`__.
#. To update the SBL with a newer version, copy the sbl image (sbl_mmcsd_img_mcu1_0_release.tiimage) to the SD card. 
   Rename it to **tiboot3.bin**
#. To update the SYSFW with a newer version, copy the system firmware image (sysfw.bin) to the SD card. 
#. Copy the generated application image(\*.appimage) to the SD card. Rename it to 
   **app**

**Booting the testcase  from SD card**

#. Insert SD card into the SD card slot of the board.
#. Refer Boot Modes section in the `AM6x EVM Hardware Users Guide 
   <http://www.ti.com/lit/pdf/spruim7>`__  to setup EVM to boot from MMCSD.
#. Open a serial communication terminal like TeraTerm, MiniCom on host
   PC and connect to the MCU UART console port
#. Power cycle the board to boot the appliation from the SD card.
#. The test logs will be displayed on the MCU UART
   
**Booting Via OSPI flash**

#. `Programming the OSPI flash <http://software-dl.ti.com/processor-sdk-rtos/esd/docs/latest/rtos/index_board.html#uniflash>`__
#. Booting the testcase from OSPI flash


**Booting the testcase from OSPI flash**

#. Refer Boot Modes section in the `AM6x EVM Hardware Users Guide 
   <http://www.ti.com/lit/pdf/spruim7>`__  to setup EVM to boot from OSPI.
#. Open a serial communication terminal like TeraTerm, MiniCom on host
   PC and connect to the MCU UART console port
#. Power cycle  the board to boot the appliation from the OSPI flash.
#. The test logs will be displayed on the MCU UART

.. warning::   If sysfw.bin is not present in the boot media, the boot will fail without displaying any
               logs on the MCU UART. SBL enables UART logging only after successfully starting the system
               firmware image. If the system firmware load fails, the RBL will eventually reset the system.
               
               
EVM Setup for testing SBL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For information on board specific requirements like power supply, UART console port 
connections refer the Hardware User guide of the respective boards.

The configurations needed to setup UART console through a serial terminal 
application on host PC are listed in the next section.

**UART Console Setup**

PDK SBL prints messages on the UART Serial Console running on the host. Hence, a 
serial terminal application (like Tera Term/HyperTerminal/minicom) should be 
running on the host. 

-  The host serial port must be configured at 115200 baud, no parity, 1  stop bit 
   and no flow control.
-  Please ensure that the local echo setting for the terminal is turned  off.
-  All SBL prints are routed to the `MCU UART <http://software-dl.ti.com/processor-sdk-rtos/esd/docs/latest/rtos/index_how_to_guides.html#uart-connection>`__
-  To verify setup is correct, setup the EVM to boot from UART  as the Primary Boot 
   Device(refer `AM6x EVM Hardware Users Guide <http://www.ti.com/lit/pdf/spruim7>`__.
   Power cycle the EVM, and look for the string CCCCCCC on the UART.
