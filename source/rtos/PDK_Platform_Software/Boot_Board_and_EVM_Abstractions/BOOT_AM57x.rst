   :name: overview-1

The Secondary Bootloader (SBL) for AM57xx device initializes the
execution environment for multi-core application and this can be used to
demonstrate an out-of-box experience.The section covers additional
details including execution sequence, tools and additional flashing
instructions.

.. rubric:: Bootloader Execution Sequence
   :name: bootloader-execution-sequence

-  **Power On Reset**
-  **ROM Bootloader (RBL)**

   -  Software pre-programmed in ROM memory starts executing
   -  Checks Sysboot pins and choose booting device
   -  If no valid bootloader found on booting device, RBL checks for
      next booting device.
   -  Platform configuration and initialization.
   -  Configures DPLL and clock settings for MPU, and boot media like
      I2C, MMCSD, SD/MMC, SPI, QSPI, Ethernet etc for reliable boot.
   -  The sequence depends on RBL execution flow and Sysboot pins.
   -  RBL gets image size and load address by checking TI Image Header
      appended on bootloader binary(.bin). Check binary formats.
   -  Loads the binary to internal memory at the Load address fetched
      from TI Image Header
   -  Passes control to Secondary Bootloader(SBL)

-  **Secondary bootloader(SBL)**

   -  User level secondary bootloader(SBL) begins execution from
      internal memory by running basic initialization routines like
      setting up Stack, BSS and then jumps to main() to begin Board
      Initialization.
   -  Board Initialization is done by a call to **Board_init()** API.For
      additional details refer `Processor SDK Board
      Support <http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Processor_SDK_RTOS_Board_Support>`__.
   -  It includes setting up PLLs, enabling clocks to all interfaces and
      modules, performing pinmux and setting up UART console.
   -  Once Board Initialization is complete, it enables clocks to the
      slave cores like C66x/DSP, IPU, etc and brings them out of reset.
   -  Parses Multicore Application image located in memory device and
      copies it to DDR memory based on load address for different
      sections.
   -  Once copy is successful it transfers control to application.

-  **Application then starts executing from DDR**.

   style="margin: 5px; padding: 2px 10px; background-color: #ecffff; border-left: 5px solid #3399ff;">

**NOTE**

-  RBL requires boot loader to be in a special format with a header
   appended to the binary image. The header shall contain the load
   address of the bootloader and size of the bootloader image.
-  For more information on the TI header refer TRM document

.. rubric:: Tools and Binary Formats
   :name: tools-and-binary-formats

This section lists out the various tools and scripts used by SBL for
different boot modes and those required to create a bootable application
image.

**SBL/MLO image format:**

| To generate the *MLO*, SBL uses tiImageGen tool to prepend the sbl.bin
  image with the TI header information. The image format has been
  described in detail in the Image Format Section of the\ `AM57xx
  Technical Reference manual <http://www.ti.com/lit/pdf/spruhz6>`__

**Application image format:**

A bootable application image can be created by using the Am57xImageGen
script provided under tools folder as part of sbl. It can be located at
*<PDK_INSTALL_DIR>\packages\ti\boot\sbl\tools\scripts* folder.

The Am57xImageGen script uses out2rprc and multicoreImageGen format
conversion tools to create the final application image. Graphical view
of the multicore application image is provided below:

.. Image:: ../images/Multicore_app_image.png

The script creates the bootable image in 2 steps

**Step 1: Conversion to RPRC format conversion**

-  Firstly, application executable is converted from ELF/COFF format
   (.out) to custom TI Rprc binary image using out2rprc tool. This tool
   strips out the initialized sections from the executable file (i.e.
   \*.out) and places them in a compact format that the SBL can
   understand. The output (bin) file is typically much smaller than the
   original executable (out) file.
-  The rprc files are intermediate files in a format that is consumed by
   MulticoreImageGen tool that generates the final binary.

**RPRC File Header Format**

+------------+----------------------------+
| Offset     | Binary value               |
+============+============================+
| 0x00000000 | **Magic Word(43525052)**   |

| **Step 2: Multicore Image file generation**

-  RPRC files for each cores is combined into a single multicore
   bootable application image.

Booting from QSPI flash involves two steps-

#. Flashing bootloader and app image to QSPI flash.
#. Booting the target.

.. rubric:: Preparing Flash Device
   :name: preparing-flash-device

Use the CCS based qspi_flash_writer.out utility provided in
<*TI_PDK_INSTALL_DIR>\packages\ti\boot\sbl\tools\flashwriter\qspi\<Board>'*
to flash the SBL image at offset 0 and application image at offset
0x80000 to the QSPI device.

QSPI device Memory Map:

+----------------+-----------------------------+
| Offset 0x00    | SBL                         |
+----------------+-----------------------------+
| Offset 0x80000 | Application Multicore Image |
+----------------+-----------------------------+

The images can be flashed into QSPI flash by following steps given
below.

#. Copy QSPI mode SBL image
   *TI_PDK_INSTALL_DIR\packages\ti\boot\sbl\binary\<BoardName>\qspi\bin\MLO*
   and application image(app) generated using the Script into the SD
   card.
   Rename the bootloader file to 'boot' and application image to 'app'
   with no extensions. 
#. Copy 'config' file into the SD card, the config file should contain
   names of the image to be flashed and the offset.
   A sample config file can be found at
   *TI_PDK_INSTALL_DIR\packages\ti\boot\sbl\tools\flashWriter\qspi\config*.
   Do not change the name of the config file.
   **NOTE:** "config" file can be used without any modifications if
   bootloader and application images are renamed to "boot" and "app".
   **NOTE:** Do not rename the bootloader to be copied to SD card as
   "MLO", as MMCSD bootloader expects "MLO" and "app" to boot.
#. Now SD card contains 3 files 1)boot 2)app 3)config files.
   config file contains the address of boot image as 0x0 and app image
   as 0x80000.
   Insert it into the SD card slot.
#. Connect the board with CCS and and load the prebuilt qspi flash
   writer application from
   $(TI_PDK_INSTALL_DIR)\packages\ti\boot\sbl\tools\flashWriter\qspi\bin\<BoardName>\\
#. Run the QSPI flash writer application. You will see the following
   logs on the EVM's UART console.
#. After the images have been flashed to the QSPI device disconnect from
   CCS and do a power reset to boot from the QSPI memory.

**NOTE**

-  After the application boots and is running on the SOC, it is free to
   use the SBL_MEM region.
-  The pinmux data from the board library and MMU Table are part of the
   SBL_MEM region indicated in the figure above. If pinmux data needs to
   be placed at a specific location then users can update the SBL linker

.. rubric:: SBL Customization
   :name: sbl-customization

**Changing boot media offsets**

The location at which SBL resides on the flash is predefined by the ROM
bootloader spec and so these defaults can`t be changed. However the SBL
is a user defined bootloader so many of the defaults can easily be
modified to meet application requirements. For example the flash offset
location from which the bootloader reads the application is configured
in the source files located under
PDK_INSTALL_PATH\packages\ti\boot\sbl\src\<BOOT_MEDIA>

Examples of customization that can be changed:

-  QSPI/SPI flash offsets: These offsets are configured in sbl_qspi.c
   and sbl_spi.c
-  MMCSD: The name of the application is hard coded as app in function
   SBL_MMCBootImage in the sbl_mmcsd.c

| 
| **Speeding up boot by increasing speed of the boot interface**

The SBL for AM57xx devices uses LLD drivers to read and write from boot
media supported. The SBL uses the default SOC configuration of the
drivers and the speeds setup. For example, the SPI driver default SPI
bitrate is 1 MHz (Refer
PDK_INSTALL_PATH\packages\ti\drv\spi\src\SPI_drv.c) so if you wish to
speed up boot you can update the SPI parameter in the SBL as shown
below:

::

     SPI_Params_init(&spiParams);
     spiParams.bitRate = 24000000U;

The configuration of the driver is usually done in the
boot/sbl/soc/<device>/sbl_soc.c file.

-  **For SD/MMC**: You can configure higher speed and change bus width
   using MMCSD_v1_HwAttrs_s or MMCSD_v0_HwAttrs_s
-  **For QSPI**: 2 pin and 4 pin mode, and input frequency is configured
   using QSPI_HwAttrs in the QSPI driver. Check driver for defaults.

Also, check to see if the CACHE and MMU settings for the ARM core are
setup to enable fast boot.

**NOTE**
**SYSBOOT settings for AM57xx**
The SYSBOOT configuration in your hardware using Sitara devices
(AM3/AM4/AM5) can play a big role in the time required to boot
successfully. On these devices the boot pins configure a boot sequence
for the ROM bootloader to check for valid boot image so if you have a
preferred boot mode designers are required to use SYSBOOT setup such
that the preferred boot media is first in the boot sequence. If the
preferred boot media occurs later boot sequence, the boot is likely to
add the time required by RBL to check other boot media for an valid
image. For example if QSPI is the preferred boot media on your AM57xx
hardware then you should have system configure SYSBOOT to boot of QSPI
first using SYSBOOT setting for QSPI_1 or QSPI4 for Memory preferred
booting or Production booting (Refer: Initialization chapter in
TRM).Incorrect SYSBOOT configuration can causes long delays especially
if peripheral boot is configured to be one of the preferred boot modes
in the boot order

**Reducing size of SBL and application**

Another way to optimize boot times is to reduce the size of the binary
that needs to be loaded by the bootloader by building the app with
optimization for code size using -Os (GNU GCC) and for -O<level> when
using TI compilers.

Other than compiler based optimizations developers can actively shutdown
non-essential modules and features to reduce code size. For example if
UART logging is not required or DDR memory is not connected in the
system, the initialization functions can be removed to reduce code size.

-  **SBL AVS and ABB setup**

AVS and ABB configuration is mandated for normal operation of AM57xx
devices. All Processor SDK RTOS releases v3.3 and later contain SBL that
sets up AVS and ABB configuration features using PM LLD APIs The
complete details of PMIC configuration and AVS and ABB configuration
required by the chip for different OPP has been implemented in the file:

PDK_INSTALL_PATH\packages\ti\boot\sbl\board\src\sbl_avs_config.c If you
are using the same PMIC as GP EVM or IDK platform then you can reuse the
settings as is in SBL for your custom platform

-  **Configuring entry point for SBL**

The two key files that help setup the entry point in the SBL build are
"sbl/soc/<SOC_NAME>/sbl_init.S" and the linker command file
"sbl/soc/<SOC_NAME>/linker.cmd". The global symbol Entry is used to
provide the entry point to the SBL. The Base address of the memory
section SBL_MEM is then used by the tiimage and GP Header tool to
provide RBL the guidance to find the entry point to pass control. After
MLO is created check the TI image format file(MLO or \_ti.bin) or the GP
Header file to confirm that the entry point matches the location of
Entry symbol in the sbl.map

**NOTE**
The object file created by sbl_init.S should always be the first object
file in the link order for the symbol Entry to be placed at the BASE
address of the memory section SBL_MEM
