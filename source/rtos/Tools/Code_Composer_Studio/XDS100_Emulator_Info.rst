.. rubric:: What is the XDS100
   :name: what-is-the-xds100

-  The XDS100 emulator is Texas Instruments' ultra-low-cost
   USB-interface JTAG hardware reference design.
-  The XDS100 emulator provides JTAG access to Texas Instruments' JTAG
   based devices.
-  It is compatible with `Code Composer
   Studio </index.php/Code_Composer_Studio>`__\ ™ development
   environment.
-  TI creates the reference design and our 3rd party partners create the
   JTAG emulator products for end use.
-  The XDS100s are available as discrete emulators, or can be embedded
   on a development card (DSK, EVM, etc.).
-  There are 3 versions of the XDS100. The XDS100v1 is the original
   XDS100 design. The XDS100v2 is an updated XDS100 design with more
   capability. The XDS100v3 is an updated XDS100v2 design with support
   for the 1149.7 protocol.
-  Performance of the XDS100 is lower than the
   `XDS510 </index.php/XDS510>`__ and `XDS560 </index.php/XDS560>`__.
   This means that program and data downloads will take a longer time
   than with `XDS510 </index.php/XDS510>`__ and
   `XDS560 </index.php/XDS560>`__ emulators. Also, stepping in "C" and
   "Assembly" will be slower with XDS100 when compared to
   `XDS510 </index.php/XDS510>`__ or `XDS560 </index.php/XDS560>`__
   emulators.

.. rubric:: Which XDS100 is right for me?
   :name: which-xds100-is-right-for-me

-  XDS100v1 emulators are only recommended for users who need to use
   Code Composer Studio v3.3, anyone using Code Composer Studio v4 or
   later should consider an XDS100v2 or later emulator due to the
   increased performance.  Some of our 3rd Party partners have
   implemented XDS100v2 emulators that can also operate in v1 mode for
   compatibility with Code Composer Studio v3.3.

| **Note**: Code Composer Studio v3.3 ONLY supports XDS100v1 hardware
  emulator. XDS100v2 hardware is NOT supported on Code Composer Studio
  v3.3.

| **Note**: Blackhawk has a model D version of XDS100v2 which can be
  configured to work as a v1 or v2 product. They provide a utility to
  re-program the device to act as a xds100v1, so the same product can be
  used with both CCS3.3 and CCS4. The firmware update utilities can be
  found on their `Blackhawk XDS100 Support
  Page. <http://www.blackhawk-dsp.com/support/xds100>`__
| A. Install Code Composer Studio and XDS100 Software before connecting
  XDS100 USB hardware.

#. Install the Code Composer Studio version, service release and/or
   XDS100 SW as detailed in the table below prior to connecting the
   XDS100 SW.

B. Connect the XDS100 hardware

#. Make sure the XDS100 Software is installed FIRST per the table above
   **before** plugging in the XDS100 HW to the PC.
#. Connect USB cable from the PC to the XDS100 hardware. Connect the
   JTAG to the target board (be careful to plug it in correctly: pin 1
   should go to pin 1. Red strip usually indicates the side of pin 1)
#. You will notice small popups to inform user that USB hardware is
   recognized and installed correctly. No input are required.

C. Setup Code Composer Studio v3.3

#. Select CC Setup icon from the desktop.
#. From the filters panel, select the platform "xds100usb emulator".
   This will give you a list of predefined configurations. Select the
   one appropriate for your device
#. Save your configuration and exit CC Setup
#. Start Code Composer Studio
#. In Code Composer Studio, go Debug-->Connect. Note: "connect to
   target" may take long time (>5 seconds) for the first time XDS100 USB
   is connected to target. It is not the case with subsequent "connect"
   operations.

.. rubric:: What are the known issues?
   :name: what-are-the-known-issues

-  XDS100 debuggers suffer a **severe performance impact** when using
   Virtual Machines (VMware, Virtualbox, Parallels, etc.) and Linux as a
   guest OS. Additional details are shown `at this
   page </index.php/VMware_with_CCS#Linux_as_a_guest_OS>`__.
-  While loading a large program or program section, the file load
   status bar may appear frozen when it is not frozen. The status bar is
   showing section load start and completion.
-  When a second FTDI device is plugged in (ex: FT232RL), and it
   receives a lower chain number, the XDS100 SW will address it instead
   of the FT2232 used by the XDS100. Solution: only plug the XDS100 HW
   into the PC. This has been fixed with `Code Composer Studio
   v4 </index.php/Code_Composer_Studio_v4>`__ support for the XDS100v2
   **ONLY** (XDS100v1 still has this issue).
-  XDS100 SW Driver does not install properly under Windows Vista 64 bit
   using CCSv3.3
-  If "Option" under CCSv3.3 “connect to target at CCS startup” is
   enabled and c674x target board is connected, then the following error
   is reported when you try to "Disconnect" for the 1st time. It works
   fine on 2nd attempt to disconnect. Note, this has been fixed for CCS
   v4.

::

    Error:
    Error 0xA0002020/-150
    Error during: Execution, Control,
    This error was generated by TI's USCIF driver.

    SC_ERR_POD_FAIL <-150>
    This utility failed to operate the adapter for a custom emulator.
    The adapter returned an error for unknown reasons.

-  When selecting OMAPL137 configuration in CCS 4.0.2, the GEL files
   cause the connection to be hung. Remove the GEL file from the target
   configuration. This has been fixed in CCSv5.2 and newer.
-  ETB for OMAPL137/8 is not working. Error of "ETB definitions cannot
   be loaded. Device not supported." is reported. ETB11 for OMAPL137/138
   is not supported at this time. This has been fixed in CCSv5 and
   newer.
-  When installating XDS100v2 patch via update manager, CCS says that
   the feature is not digitally signed. Continue installation. This has
   been fixed in CCSv5 releases.
-  Target power loss detection is not working in CCS v4.1/v4.1.x. This
   has been fixed in CCS v4.2.
-  Adaptive clocking use with OMAPL138/ARM9 cores connection reliability
   varies by card. This results in connection errors. A fix has been
   identified by upgrading the CPLD on XDS100v2 designs. Please see
   `XDS100#Q:_How_can_I_update_the_CPLD_on_my_XDS100v2.3F </index.php/XDS100#Q:_How_can_I_update_the_CPLD_on_my_XDS100v2.3F>`__

.. rubric:: Troubleshooting
   :name: troubleshooting

-  Check whether the installation process was followed.
-  Please check the FAQ questions below. (`Troubleshooting
   FAQ </index.php/XDS100#Troubleshooting_FAQ>`__)
-  **Please check the section regarding `Troubleshooting
   CCS </index.php/Troubleshooting_CCS>`__.**
-  Check your Windows System Devices. When properly installed, the
   XDS100 should look like the below image. If the XDS100 does not show
   up in the Windows device manager or shows with an error, then it is
   likely that the XDS100 was not programmed properly (contact
   manufacturer), there is a conflict with another FTDI based USB device
   (see FAQ below for details) or the drivers became corrupt (check the
   reinstall section above the screenshots)

   -  You can run the utility <xds100serial.exe> to find out which
      VID/PID are programmed in the device. This utility is typically
      located at the directory
      ``CCS_INSTALL_DIR/ccsv6/ccs_base/common/uscif``

-  Check USB cable or change the USB port the emulator is connected
-  Power cycle your target
-  You may want to check the `VID/PID EEPROM was programed
   correctly </index.php/XDS100#Q:_How_can_I_check_if_the_VID.2FPID_for_the_EEPROM_are_programmed_correctly.3F>`__
-  Sometimes the use of different drivers such as libFTDI (used by
   OpenOCD, for example) or a simple corruption on other Windows .inf
   files may cause an improper initialization of the XDS100 device
   drivers. Please check `this forum
   thread <https://e2e.ti.com/support/development_tools/code_composer_studio/f/81/p/522774/1904904>`__
   for details.

I get: "Error connecting to the target: Error 0x80000240/-600 Fatal
Error during: Initialization, OCS"

-  A: This can happen if the FDTI USB driver have not been properly
   uninstalled / re-installed (i.e. if CCSv4 uninstall did not complete
   properly). I resolved it by going to Device Manager then right click
   on:

TI XDS100 Channel B -> Uninstall then TI XDS100 Channel A -> Uninstall
Then it re-installed itself when re-connecting the XDS100-based USB
stick and "Target Connect" worked afetr re-starting CCSv4

.. rubric:: Q: I want to put an XDS100v2 on my EVM / DSK / card. Can I
   do this?
   :name: q-i-want-to-put-an-xds100v2-on-my-evm-dsk-card.-can-i-do-this

-  A: Yes, but please make sure to re-use the entire XDS100 design as-is
   to ensure compatibility with the software! Removing the CPLD
   implementing with discrete logic will result in a design that is just
   as complex and expensive as using the CPLD.

.. rubric:: Q: Can I use port B as a UART?
   :name: q-can-i-use-port-b-as-a-uart

-  A: Yes. The TI XDS100v2 reference design uses the port A of the
   FTDI2232H to be for JTAG. This leaves the port B available for use
   either to program the CPLD and/or for use as a UART. The XDS100v2
   design puts the CPLD JTAG programming on a selected number of pins
   (see XDS100v2 readme for details). This allows the CPLD to be
   programmed via the FTDI device, greatly simplifying manufacturing.
-  Please note that there is a known issue with the current XDS100v2
   reference design with the placement of the BCBUS. If you plan to use
   the port B, please check the readme of the XDS100v2 reference design
   for details. Generally, a serial port on BCBUS should connect the
   CPLD as follows: BCBUS1 -> CPLD TCK, BCBUS2 -> CPLD TDI, BCBUS5 ->
   CPLD TDO, BCBUS6 -> CPLD TMS.
-  Please note that using UART mode simultaneously with `Code Composer
   Studio v4 </index.php/Code_Composer_Studio_v4>`__ has NOT been tested
   on the XDS100v2 design and is not officially supported. Experience
   with C2000 ControlCards which implement this functionality indicate
   the FTDI driver can handle such an interaction. \*The C2000 control
   card does implement a serial port simultaneous with JTAG, but it is
   done with an XDS100v1 design. There is a thread on the forum at
   `[1] <http://e2e.ti.com/forums/p/7493/30331.aspx#30331>`__. The FTDI
   driver gives each half of the FTDI chip a seperate USB handle and USB
   endpoint, so they are essentially independent. The FTDI supplied
   software is the software that is needed to get this support; there is
   no TI specific software needed for this support.

   need both?
   :name: q-i-see-both-14-pin-and-20-pin-compact-ti-headers.-do-i-need-both

-  A: Both are in the reference schematic for testing Code Composer
   Studio support. In the TI prototypes, we populate just one of the 2
   headers. This allows use to test the extended capability available
   with the 20 pin connection. Please use the header that is needed for
   your target card.

.. rubric:: Q: How to maximize performance of XDS100 under CCS?
   :name: q-how-to-maximize-performance-of-xds100-under-ccs

A: A couple of things can be done to improve performance under CCS.
Generally, the goal is to minimze the amount of information transferred
for every action

-  Make the disassembly window smaller or close the disassembly window.
   Stepping and general performance are better in the "C" language
   environment if the disassembly window is closed.
-  Minimize the number of registers shown.
-  Minimize the number of watch windows/variable windows.
-  Turn off mixed C/disassembly mode.
-  Make sure you are plugged into a High Speed USB2.0 port (XDS100v2)
-  Single step debugging is rather slow, therefore a better performance
   is obtained by running straight to specific points in your code by
   setting breakpoints in these locations.

.. rubric:: Q: Does the XDS100 support debugging the C672x processor?
   :name: q-does-the-xds100-support-debugging-the-c672x-processor

-  A: No.

.. rubric:: Q: Does DSP/BIOS Real Time Analysis with RTDX work?
   :name: q-does-dspbios-real-time-analysis-with-rtdx-work

-  Q: When using DSP/BIOS and the Real Time Analysis setup for RTDX, I
   get the cpu graph and real time logs updating. Does this mean RTDX is
   working/supported on the XDS100?
-  A: RTDX is not supported on the XDS100. Please see the seciton `What
   features does the XDS100 NOT
   support </index.php/XDS100#Features_NOT_supported.C2.A0>`__

.. rubric:: Q: Can I plug more than one XDS100 (multiple XDS100) into a
   PC?
   :name: q-can-i-plug-more-than-one-xds100-multiple-xds100-into-a-pc

-  With CCS v4.1 (with the XDS100v2 SW) and above you can plug more than
   one XDS100 on a single PC. This is not supported with CCSv3.3.
-  Each XDS100 must have a unique serial number. Run xds100serial.exe
   installed under CCSv4.1 "<install_dir>/ccsv4/common/uscif/utility" to
   get the serial number of each connected XDS100 emulator. Create
   Target Configuration for 2 emulators, Under “connection properties”,
   change “emulator selection” to “select by serial number” option.
   Enter the corresponding serial number for each emulator. Save and
   launch debugger.
-  With CCSv5, the xds100serial.exe utility is located in the folder
   "<install_dir>/ccsv5/ccs_base/common/uscif"
-  With older versions of CCS (ex: CCS v3.3), there is a known issue
   (see above) which prevents the CCS XDS100 driver from seeing more
   than one XDS100 in a system. If more than one is in a system, only
   the first one is recognized.
-  xds100serial.exe can detect both XDS100v1 and XDS100v2 emulators.

   :name: q-how-can-i-use-the-xds100v2s-second-port-as-a-serial-port-uart

-  A: Ensure that there is a physical connection between the FTDI Port B
   TX and RX pins and your target serial device and then follow these
   steps:

#. Click Start, Right click on My Computer, and select Properties
#. Navigate to the Hardware tab of the System Properties dialog box and
   select Device Manager
#. In the list of devices, expand the group titled Universal Serial Bus
   controllers and look for a device named TI XDS100 Channel B
#. Right click on this device and select Properties
#. On the Advanced tab of this dialog box, ensure that the box labeled
   "Load VCP" (virtual COM port) is checked. Click OK when you are done.
#. Unplug and replug the XDS100v2
#. After the XDS100V2 has been re-connected, look for a group called
   Ports (COM & LPT) in Device Manager. Expand this group and look for
   an entry labaled USB Serial Port (COMXXX).
#. The COM number associated with this port is the one you want to use
   in Hyperterminal, PuTTy, or your favorite terminal application.

.. rubric:: Q: How can I turn on adaptive clocking?

.. raw:: html

   </div>

-  Note that the XDS100v2 users should upgrade to the latest CPLD. An
   upgrade of the CPLD will improve reliability for adaptive clocking
   connections. To update the XDS100v2 CPLD, please see
   `XDS100#Q:_How_can_I_update_the_CPLD_on_my_XDS100v2.3F </index.php/XDS100#Q:_How_can_I_update_the_CPLD_on_my_XDS100v2.3F>`__

.. rubric:: Q: My XDS100v2 does not work reliabily with the OMAPL138 /
   DM365 / ARM926 core
   :name: q-my-xds100v2-does-not-work-reliabily-with-the-omapl138-dm365-arm926-core

-  A: This can be caused by a variety of issues such as where the PLL is
   programmed to the use of `Adaptive
   Clocking </index.php/Adaptive_Clocking>`__ emulator. Usually, it is
   seen as a problem around the PLL setup. This is because the core PLL
   clock is changing. Example error message:

::

    ARM9: GEL Output: Setup PLL0...

    ARM9: Trouble Writing Memory Block at 0x1c40900 on Page 0 of Length 0x4: 0x00000004/-2030 @ marker 1026 Error during: Register, Access to an unknown or invalid register was attempted.

    ARM9: GEL: Error while executing OnTargetConnect(): target access failed.

A couple of things to try:

#. Setup the PLL by executing code (ex: UBoot, etc.) instead of using
   the GEL file. (preferred)
#. Turn on adaptive clocking
   `XDS100#Q:_How_can_I_turn_on_adaptive_clocking.3F </index.php/XDS100#Q:_How_can_I_turn_on_adaptive_clocking.3F>`__
   and setup the timeouts to very slow. In this mode, it is still better
   to "run" the code and not "step" it.
#. Make sure you have the latest CPLD version. To update the XDS100v2
   CPLD, please see
   `XDS100#Q:_How_can_I_update_the_CPLD_on_my_XDS100v2.3F </index.php/XDS100#Q:_How_can_I_update_the_CPLD_on_my_XDS100v2.3F>`__

   :name: q-on-connecting-the-usb-i-get-the-error-message-the-file-ftdibus.sys-on-ftdi-usb-drivers-disk-is-needed

-  A: The USB drivers are likely missing. Please see the installation
   instructions above to install the software before trying to connect
   the XDS100.
-  A: It may also be that the FTDI EEPROM is not properly progrmmed.
   Please contact your XDS100 vendor to have the problem corrected. You
   could also see the section on

.. rubric:: Q: I got a -150 SC_ERR_POD_FAIL error, what does this mean?
   :name: q-i-got-a--150-sc_err_pod_fail-error-what-does-this-mean

-  For an XDS100, this means that Code Composer Studio is having a
   problem talking to the XDS100. The problem is with the communication
   between the adapter and the FTDI chip. Either the FTDI driver has
   returned an error, or the chip failed to return the expected number
   of bytes to Code Composer Studio. In practice, this has usually been
   found to be a problem with the FTDI drivers. Either the wrong drivers
   were installed, or there is a conflict with FTDI drivers used for
   another device, or a software process that hasn’t completely
   terminated and is holding the device open. In the case where a
   software process hasn't terminated, it may be that Code Composer
   Studio may not have terminated properly. Check the Windows Task
   Manager that Code Composer Studio related processes are terminated
   prior to re-starting.

.. Image:: ../images/Xds100v1poderror.jpg

-  A: This can occur for several reasons. With XDS100 systems, this can
   occur because the EEPROM was not programmed properly. Please check
   with your XDS100 manufacturer.

   :name: q-what-happens-when-i-plug-a-xds100v2-in-to-my-card-but-select-xds100v1-or-xds100-as-the-emulator

-  A: The output from a `path length
   test </index.php/Debugging_JTAG_Connectivity_Problems>`__ will look
   like it is passing, with a zero - bit path length. This is because
   the XDS100v2 has a loopback mode which is used in testing. When the
   XDS100v1 software is used, it invokes this loopback mode.

   :name: q-what-happens-when-i-plug-a-xds100v1-into-a-card-but-select-an-xds100v2-in-ccs

-  A: The output from `path length
   test </index.php/Debugging_JTAG_Connectivity_Problems>`__ will vary
   with the target device. This is because the XDS100v2 uses the pins on
   the communications chip different from how it was used on the
   XDS100v1. On some devices such as c28x, it may cause the device to
   enter an unexpected bootmode. For the example with a 28x core, a
   3-bit path length was seen vs a 38-bit path lengh (expected). This
   was because a bootmode was selected.

-  A: `Check your VID/PID
   value. </index.php/XDS100#Q:_How_can_I_check_if_the_VID.2FPID_for_the_EEPROM_are_programmed_correctly.3F>`__
   If it does not match, you need to contact your manufacturer, or get
   the VID/PID EEPROM programmed properly.
-  A: With CCS 4.1.2 and newer, a bug was fixed so that the XDS100
   software could properly connect only to a XDS100 VID/PID values. In
   older versions of CCS, the XDS100 software would connect to any
   VID/PID value causing incompatibilties with non-XDS100 FTDI based
   devices plugged into the same PC.

.. rubric:: Q: What device voltages are supported by the XDS100v1?
   :name: q-what-device-voltages-are-supported-by-the-xds100v1

-  A: The XDS100v1 reference design supports 1.8V and 3.3V targets. The
   SN74CBT3125 (U3) and SN74LVC2T45 (U5) perform the voltage buffering.
   The MCP6041 (IC5) and TLC393 (IC1B) are used for voltage sensing. The
   74HC74(IC3A) and TLC393 (IC1A) form the power detect circuit by
   reaching the TVO pin.

.. rubric:: Q: I work with high voltages, where can I get an isolation
   adapter?
   :name: q-i-work-with-high-voltages-where-can-i-get-an-isolation-adapter

-  A: TI offers an isolation adapter (TI part #: TMDSADP1414-ISO)
   `here <http://focus.ti.com/docs/toolsw/folders/print/tmdsadp.html>`__.

.. rubric:: Q: Can I change the serial number on my XDS100v2?
   :name: q-can-i-change-the-serial-number-on-my-xds100v2

-  A: Yes, using the FTDI MProg utility and one of the configurations in
   `Media:Xds100v2serial.zip </images/8/85/Xds100v2serial.zip>`__ so you
   can change the serial number of an XDS100v2 product if desired.
-  **NOTE: Support for MProg is being deprecated in favor of FT_Prog
   (also available on the same site). If you are having issue with
   MProg, try FT_Prog**
-  If you plan to use 1 or more XDS100v2 emulators in CCSv4
   simultaneously then each XDS100v2 must have a unique serial number.
-  For ease of use Spectrum Digital generally programs the XDS100v2 with
   a fixed serial number as this is the most common use case and is
   consistent with other low cost Spectrum Digital products.

::

    Steps:
    1) Launch MProg.
    2) Load the desired configuration.
         For Fixed Serial Number:         File->Open SDXDS100v2_FIXED.EPT
         For Autogenerated Serial Number: File->Open SDXDS100v2.EPT
    3) Enable programming of pre-programmed devices if needed.
           File->Edit and uncheck "Only Program Blank Devices"
    4) Program the ROM

   of FTDI)
   :name: q-on-xds100v1-design-what-does-the-oe-signal-do-pin-12-of-ftdi

-  A: On the XDS100v1 design, this OE signal on pin 12 of the FTDI chip
   comes from the ICA3A device (74HC74, flip flop). The ICA3A/IC1A
   section of the circuit samples the TVD signal to detect whether there
   is target power. This signal is read by the debugger via the GPIO on
   the FTDI. This signal has an opposite signal /OE which goes to U3. U3
   provides a buffer which performs the voltage translation.

.. rubric:: Q: How can I check if the VID/PID for the EEPROM are
   programmed correctly?
   :name: q-how-can-i-check-if-the-vidpid-for-the-eeprom-are-programmed-correctly

-  A: You can find the VID/PID in windows by using the windows device
   manager and selecting details. You can also use the FTDI utilities
   such as MPROG or FT_Prog. When using MPROG or FT_Prog, you need to
   scan devices to read the ID.

**IMPORTANT!** This is not applicable for BeagleBone Rev A5 and greater
(which uses a XDS100). Check `this
