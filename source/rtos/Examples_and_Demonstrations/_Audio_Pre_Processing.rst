Introduction
============

This page describes the audio pre-processing for speech recognition
framework provided in the Processor-SDK for RTOS. This demo illustrates
the integration of Beamforming (BF), Adaptive Spectral Noise Reduction
(ASNR), Multiple Source Selection (MSS) and Dynamic Range Compression
(DRC) components and provides a framework for application development.

.. Image:: ../images/Aud_pre_processing_arch.png

The key functions in this use case include:

-  Read 7 canned audio input files from hard drive into buffers in DDR
   using GEL function
-  Generate 12 virtual mics using BF (Beamforming) (30° apart)
-  Apply ASNR (Adaptive Spectral Noise Reduction) on each virtual mic
-  Use MSS (Multiple Source Selection) to select the best virtual mic
   from the 12 virtual mics
-  Do DRC (Dynamic Range Compression) on the best virtual mic
-  Display performance data
-  Write one processed audio channel from buffer in DDR to hard drive
   using GEL function

This demo utilizes other Processor SDK features/components:

-  **SYS/BIOS** application utilizing TI-RTOS features for
   DSP-C66x/C674x core
-  **UIA** for instrumentation logging

The audio components are available in AER and VOLIB packages, which are
optimized for C66x cores, so this demo not available for all devices.
Currently, the following devices and EVMs are supported:

-  AM57x, on the AM572x GP EVM
-  K2G, on the K2G EVM. See TIDEP-0088
   (http://www.ti.com/tool/TIDEP-0088) for details
-  OMAP-L137, on the OMAP-L137 EVM. See TIDEP-0099
   (http://www.ti.com/tool/TIDEP-0099) for details

Software Design
===============

More about processing algorithms
--------------------------------

The application will use AER & VOLIB APIs for its noise reduction
processing needs. The following steps are performed for noise reduction:

-  Use 7 canned audio inputs to generate 12 virtual mics using
   BF(Beamforming) (30° apart)
-  Apply ASNR(Adaptive Spectral Noise Reduction) on each virtual mic
-  Use MSS(Multiple Source Selection)to select the best virtual mic from
   the 12 virtual mics
-  Do VAD(Voice Activity Detection) on the best virtual mic
-  Write 1 processed audio channel into the buffer in DDR

Framework for Audio Pre-processing
----------------------------------

The current framework is based on SYS/BIOS. The following are the
overall steps:

-  The CLK object in SYS/BIOS will be configured to generate a Software
   Interrupt(SWI) every 10 ms
-  The SWI will prepare the audio frame buffer pointers for further
   processing
-  The SWI will also send a semaphore to wake up the main thread
-  When woke up, the main thread will perform the BF, ASNR, MSS and DRC
-  The main thread will also output the final processing audio frame to
   the DDR
-  After completed the audio frame processing, the main thread will wait
   on semaphore for next audio frames to come

Both the input/output audio files are in raw PCM format (*.pcm or
\*.bin) 16 bit per sample, big endian, mono, at 16Khz. They can be
imported either by Adobe Audition or Audacity as the raw audio data.

Import Raw Audio Data File using Adobe Audition
-----------------------------------------------

-  Launch the Adobe Audition CS5.5
-  File --> Import --> Raw Data...
-  The following dialog will pop up

.. Image:: ../images/Aud_pre_processing_import.png

-  Select the raw audio file and input the correct parameters
-  Click OK
