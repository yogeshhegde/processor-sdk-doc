Overview
========

The SYS/BIOS examples gets user started with development of code using a
real-time operating system. These are simple examples that does not get
into details of software components provided in the SDK.


ARM Cortex-A53
==============

The hello example serves as a basic sanity check program for SYS/BIOS.
It demonstrates how to print the string 'hello world' to stdout. As a
sample we will use the AM65x device to describe the steps for the Cortex-A53. 

.. Note:: For future Device Support Package releases, the Hello World example for the Cortex-A53 will be added to CCS as an out-of-box experience. 

1. Create a work space folder to be used for Hello Example project 
(e.g. /ti/am65x_am53_hello_workspace), and start CCS. If prompted with 
**New Products Discovered**, install any desired products and restart 
CCS if required.

2. In CCS, go to File --> New --> 
CCS Project. 

3. Enter a project name and configure the new CCS project as follows:

 * **Target**: GPEVM_AM65x
 * **Cortex A**
 * **Device Endianness**: little

4. Under "Project Templates and examples", select "More Examples... --> Search Using Import Wizard". 
Select "hello" project and click "Finish".

5. Remove AM6548.lds from the project. Add the file **linker_a53.lds** located in the folder (PDK INSTALL PATH)/packages/ti/build/am65xx/ 
to the project.

6. Remove hello.cfg from the project. Add the file **sysbios_a53.cfg** located in the folder (PDK INSTALL PATH)/packages/ti/build/am65xx/ 
to the project.

7. Add the file **InitMmu.c** located under (IPC INSTALL PATH)/examples/AM65XX_bios_elf/ex02_messageq/host 
to the project. 

8. Select Compiler: right-click on the project, select "Properites". Under "Tool-chain", 
select "GNU v7.2.1 (Linaro aarch64)" (or higher). 

9. Build the project: right-click on the project and 
select "Build Project". 

10. Launch the target configuration using the appropriate emulator to connect to AM65x EVM 
as described in the AM65x EVM Hardware Setup Guide.

11. Right click on DMSC_Cortex_M3_0 and click Connect Target. 

12. Connect to the CortexA53_0_0 core. Load and run Hello Example out file. 
You should see Hello World string displayed on console window.

Usage Notes
===========

After execution of the hello world examples on the core, the CCS Editor
may report "Can't find a source file" error messages when you pause or
the application exits/aborts after completion. This occurs due to source
files from SYSBIOS or XDC packages not being in the default search path
of the CCS Editor. when you run into this issue, you can navigate to the
file using Locate file option in the Editor. Once you provide the
location the CCS Editor will be able to locate all the other required
files from that package based on relative path.

For example, when running SYS/BIOS Hello Example using AM57x-GP EVM if
you see the message

::

     Can't find a source file at "/db/ztree/library/trees/xdctargets/xdctargets-i02/src/gnu/targets    /arm/rtsv7A/syscalls.c"
     Locate the file or edit the source lookup path to include its location. The above file is located  under file path ${PROC_SDK_DIR}\bios_6_42_02_29\packages\gnu\targets\arm\rtsv7A

You can also prevent these issues by adding the Processor SDK components
to file search path under Windows->Preferences options in CCS GUI.

Known Issues
============

-  **SYS/BIOS examples for Cortex-A15 generate linker errors due to the
   FPU related flags**

Some versions of CCS are impacted by linker setting used in CCS RTOS
templates and may need some manual modification to set the correct
-mfpu, -mcpu and -march. If you are seeing VFP errors in the link step,
you are most likely running into this issue. To correct this issue
please check the resolution here:
