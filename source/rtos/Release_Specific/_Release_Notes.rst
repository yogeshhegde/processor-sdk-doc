Installation and Usage 
========================

The :ref:`Getting Started Guide <Processor-SDK-RTOS-Getting-Started-Guide-label>` provides
instructions on how to setup up your development environment, install
the SDK and start your development.

To uninstall the SDK, remove the individual component directories from
the installed path. This is safe to do even in Windows since these
components do not modify the Windows registry.
