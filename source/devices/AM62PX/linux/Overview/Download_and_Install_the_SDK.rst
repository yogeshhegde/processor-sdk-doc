Download and Install the SDK
============================

The |__SDK_FULL_NAME__| Installer will install the necessary components
to start Linux development on the TI microprocessor.

**The** |__SDK_FULL_NAME__| **Release supports installer only for Linux machine.**

+----------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Installer Details**                        | **Installers Name**                                                  |
+----------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| PSDK Linux AM62Px Installer (Linux version)  | ti-processor-sdk-linux-am62pxx-evm-<version>-Linux-x86-Install.bin   |
+----------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Use Linux installer for complete source package, tools, prebuilt-image, filesystems,
etc for product development.

From a windows machine, you can only flash a SD card. This can be done without
installing the SDK. Use balenaEtcher to flash SD card from windows machine.

The |__SDK_FULL_NAME__| includes the ARM GCC toolchain.
The |__SDK_FULL_NAME__| was built and tested against a specific Linux
Distribution name and version, Ubuntu |__LINUX_UBUNTU_VERSION_SHORT__|.
Note that this **does not** prevent the user from installing the SDK on other Linux
distributions.

Download & Install the SDK Installer Inside a Container
-------------------------------------------------------

TI provides a Ubuntu 22.04 based docker image with all the packages that are required to install the SDK Installer.

The Docker image is hosted on `ghcr.io/texasinstruments <https://github.com/TexasInstruments/ti-docker-images/pkgs/container/ubuntu-distro>`__.

Refer `Steps to Run SDK Installer inside a Container <https://github.com/TexasInstruments/ti-docker-images?tab=readme-ov-file#steps-to-run-sdk-installer-inside-container>`__ for a comprehensive guide.

.. note::

    Before starting the container, ensure that you have completed all the Pre-Requisites as mentioned `here <https://github.com/TexasInstruments/ti-docker-images?tab=readme-ov-file#pre-requisites>`__.

Download & Install the SDK Installer on Host
--------------------------------------------

You can download the latest |__SDK_FULL_NAME__| installer from the
|__SDK_DOWNLOAD_URL__|.

.. rubric:: Required Host Packages to Install the SDK Installer in Linux
   :name: required-host-packages-to-install-the-sdk-installer-linux

Please run the following command to install all packages required to Install the SDK Installer on Ubuntu |__LINUX_UBUNTU_VERSION_SHORT__|.

.. code-block:: console

    host# sudo apt-get install file fdisk dosfstools

.. rubric:: How to Run the SDK Installer in Linux
   :name: how-to-run-the-sdk-installer-linux

Make sure that the execute permissions are set. Bring up a terminal
window and change directories to where the installer is located
(probably the Downloads directory) and run the following commands:

.. parsed-literal::

    # For AM62Px (am62pxx-evm) Installer
    chmod +x ./ti-processor-sdk-linux-am62pxx-evm-<version>-Linux-x86-Install.bin
    ./ti-processor-sdk-linux-am62pxx-evm-<version>-Linux-x86-Install.bin

Alternatively, you can give execute permissions and run the SDK Installer
by double clicking on it within your Linux host PC.

.. note::
   As a part of the installation, the installer will run a script to configure your
   environment and extract the Linux devkit. This will cause the installation to
   continue for roughly a minute even after it shows that it has reached 100%.

.. note::
   If nothing seems to happen, your computer may be running a 32-bit version of
   its operating system. The installer is 64-bit, and will not execute properly.


**MCU+ SDK for RTOS/NO-RTOS**

.. note::
   Processor SDK Linux AM62Px contains only the Linux specific source and application intended
   to runs on A53/Linux core. For R5F and RTOS/NO-RTOS side source and applications, refer **MCU+ SDK**
   package `[Use Link] <https://software-dl.ti.com/mcu-plus-sdk/esd/AM62PX/10_01_00_33/exports/docs/api_guide_am62px/index.html>`__.
