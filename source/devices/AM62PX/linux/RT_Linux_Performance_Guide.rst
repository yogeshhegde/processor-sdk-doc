Stress-ng and Cyclic Test
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

stress-ng (next-generation) will stress test a embedded platform in various selectable ways.
It was designed to exercise various physical subsystems as well as the various
operating system kernel interfaces. stress-ng can also measure test throughput rates;
this can be useful to observe performance changes across different operating system or types of hardware.

Cyclictest is most commonly used for benchmarking RT systems.
It is one of the most frequently used tools for evaluating the relative performance of real-time systems.
Some performance tests which use Cyclictest are System benchmarking, Latency debugging with tracing and
approximating application performance.

Test command for running stress-ng and cyclictest together

``stress-ng --cpu-method=all -c 4 &``

``cyclictest -m -Sp98 -D6h -h400 -i200 -q``
