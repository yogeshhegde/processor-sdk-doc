System Benchmarks
-----------------

LMBench
^^^^^^^
LMBench is a collection of microbenchmarks of which the memory bandwidth 
and latency related ones are typically used to estimate processor 
memory system performance. More information about lmbench at
https://lmbench.sourceforge.net/whatis_lmbench.html and
https://lmbench.sourceforge.net/man/lmbench.8.html

**Latency**: :command:`lat_mem_rd-stride128-szN`, where N is equal to or smaller than the cache
size at given level measures the cache miss penalty. N that is at least
double the size of last level cache is the latency to external memory.

**Bandwidth**: :command:`bw_mem_bcopy-N`, where N is equal to or smaller than the cache size at
a given level measures the achievable memory bandwidth from software doing
a memcpy() type operation. Typical use is for external memory bandwidth
calculation. The bandwidth is calculated as byte read and written counts
as 1 which should be roughly half of STREAM copy result.

Execute the LMBench with the following:

.. code-block:: console

    cd /opt/ltp
    ./runltp -P j721e-idk-gw -f ddt/lmbench -s LMBENCH_L_PERF_0001

Dhrystone
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Dhrystone is a core only benchmark that runs from warm L1 caches in all
modern processors. It scales linearly with clock speed.

Please take note, different run may produce different slightly results.
This is advised to run this test multiple times in order to get maximum 
performance numbers.


Execute the benchmark with the following:

.. code-block:: console

    runDhrystone

.. csv-table:: Dhrystone Benchmarks
    :header: "Benchmarks","am62pxx_sk-fs: perf"

    "cpu_clock (mhz)","1400.00"

    "dhrystone_per_second (dhrystonep)","6804597.50 (min 6666666.50, max 6896551.50)"


Whetstone
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Whetstone is a benchmark primarily measuring floating-point arithmetic performance.

Execute the benchmark with the following:

.. code-block:: console

    runWhetstone

.. csv-table:: Whetstone Benchmarks
    :header: "Benchmarks","am62pxx_sk-fs: perf"

    "whetstone (mips)","5000.00"


Linpack
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Linpack measures peak double precision (64 bit) floating point performance in
solving a dense linear system.

    "linpack (kflops)","580891.00 (min 579075.00, max 583058.00)"


NBench
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
NBench which stands for Native Benchmark is used to measure macro benchmarks
for commonly used operations such as sorting and analysis algorithms.

    "string_sort (iterations)","165.90 (min 163.60, max 168.20)"


Stream
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
STREAM is a microbenchmark for measuring data memory system performance without
any data reuse. It is designed to miss on caches and exercise data prefetcher
and speculative accesses.
It uses double precision floating point (64bit) but in
most modern processors the memory access will be the bottleneck.
The four individual scores are copy, scale as in multiply by constant,
add two numbers, and triad for multiply accumulate.
For bandwidth, a byte read counts as one and a byte written counts as one,
resulting in a score that is double the bandwidth LMBench will show.

Execute the benchmark with the following:

.. code-block:: console

    stream_c

.. csv-table:: Stream Benchmarks
    :header: "Benchmarks","am62pxx_sk-fs: perf"

    "add (mb/s)","2739.62 (min 2693.40, max 2872.40)"

CoreMarkPro
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
CoreMark\ |reg|-Pro is a comprehensive, advanced processor benchmark that works
with and enhances the market-proven industry-standard EEMBC CoreMark\ |reg|
benchmark. While CoreMark stresses the CPU pipeline, CoreMark-Pro tests the
entire processor, adding comprehensive support for multicore technology, a
combination of integer and floating-point workloads, and data sets for utilizing
larger memory subsystems.

Partial I/O Data
- All voltage rails were measured to be near 0V

.. note::

   The power consumption on the vdda_1v8 rail does not include an
   oscillator on the rail that has significant current consumption.
   Since previous SDK power measurements include the oscillator on the
   rail, the reported power measurements are significantly different from
   the current reported power measurements.

.. note::

   The measurements shown are from an AM62Px SK rev E1-1. Results may vary based off of the board revision being used.

Further optimizations are possible for these low power modes. Please refer to the AM62x Power Consumption App Note (https://www.ti.com/lit/pdf/spradg1)

The performance numbers are measured without the Linux printk logs. To remove the
Linux printk logs, run the following commands in the terminal:

.. code:: console

   # Detach kernel serial console
   consoles=$(find /sys/bus/platform/devices/*.serial/ -name console)
   for console in ${consoles}; do
        echo -n N > ${console}
   done


.. note::

   The measurements shown are from using the default SDK with no extra optimizations.
