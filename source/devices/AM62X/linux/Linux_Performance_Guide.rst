LMBench
=======

LMBench is a collection of microbenchmarks of which the memory bandwidth 
and latency related ones are typically used to estimate processor 
memory system performance. More information about lmbench at
https://lmbench.sourceforge.net/whatis_lmbench.html and
https://lmbench.sourceforge.net/man/lmbench.8.html

**Latency**: lat_mem_rd-stride128-szN, where N is equal to or smaller than the cache
size at given level measures the cache miss penalty. N that is at least
double the size of last level cache is the latency to external memory.

**Bandwidth**: bw_mem_bcopy-N, where N is equal to or smaller than the cache size at
a given level measures the achievable memory bandwidth from software doing
a memcpy() type operation. Typical use is for external memory bandwidth
calculation. The bandwidth is calculated as byte read and written counts
as 1 which should be roughly half of STREAM copy result.

Execute the LMBench with the following:

::

    cd /opt/ltp
    ./runltp -P j721e-idk-gw -f ddt/lmbench -s LMBENCH_L_PERF_0001

Stream
======

STREAM is a microbenchmark for measuring data memory system performance without
any data reuse. It is designed to miss on caches and exercise data prefetcher
and speculative accesses.
It uses double precision floating point (64bit) but in
most modern processors the memory access will be the bottleneck.
The four individual scores are copy, scale as in multiply by constant,
add two numbers, and triad for multiply accumulate.
For bandwidth, a byte read counts as one and a byte written counts as one,
resulting in a score that is double the bandwidth LMBench will show.

Execute the benchmark with the following:

::

    stream_c

MultiBench
==========

MultiBench™ is a suite of benchmarks that allows processor and system designers to
analyze, test, and improve multicore processors. It uses three forms of concurrency:
Data decomposition: multiple threads cooperating on achieving a unified goal and
demonstrating a processor’s support for fine grain parallelism.
Processing multiple data streams: uses common code running over multiple threads and
demonstrating how well a processor scales over scalable data inputs.
Multiple workload processing: shows the scalability of general-purpose processing,
demonstrating concurrency over both code and data.
MultiBench combines a wide variety of application-specific workloads with the EEMBC
Multi-Instance-Test Harness (MITH), compatible and portable with most any multicore
processors and operating systems. MITH uses a thread-based API (POSIX-compliant) to
establish a common programming model that communicates with the benchmark through an
abstraction layer and provides a flexible interface to allow a wide variety of
thread-enabled workloads to be tested.

Ethernet
========

Ethernet performance benchmarks were measured using :command:`netperf` 2.7.1 https://hewlettpackard.github.io/netperf/doc/netperf.html
Test procedures were modeled after those defined in RFC-2544:
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2544, where the DUT is the TI device
and the "tester" used was a Linux PC. To produce consistent results,
it is recommended to carry out performance tests in a private network and to avoid
running NFS on the same interface used in the test. In these results,
CPU utilization was captured as the total percentage used across all cores on the device,
while running the performance test over one external interface.

UDP Throughput (0% loss) was measured by the procedure defined in RFC-2544 section 26.1: Throughput.
In this scenario, :command:`netperf` options burst_size (-b) and wait_time (-w) are used to limit bandwidth
during different trials of the test, with the goal of finding the highest rate at which
no loss is seen. For example, to limit bandwidth to 500Mbits/sec with 1472B datagram:

.. code-block:: console

   burst_size = <bandwidth (bits/sec)> / 8 (bits -> bytes) / <UDP datagram size> / 100 (seconds -> 10 ms)
   burst_size = 500000000 / 8 / 1472 / 100 = 425

   wait_time = 10 milliseconds (minimum supported by Linux PC used for testing)

UDP Throughput (possible loss) was measured by capturing throughput and packet loss statistics when
running the :command:`netperf` test with no bandwidth limit (remove -b/-w options).

In order to start a :command:`netperf` client on one device, the other device must have :command:`netserver` running.
To start :command:`netserver`:

.. code-block:: console

   netserver [-p <port_number>] [-4 (IPv4 addressing)] [-6 (IPv6 addressing)]

Running the following shell script from the DUT will trigger :command:`netperf` clients to measure
bidirectional TCP performance for 60 seconds and report CPU utilization. Parameter -k is used in
client commands to summarize selected statistics on their own line and -j is used to gain
additional timing measurements during the test.

.. code-block:: console

   #!/bin/bash
   for i in 1
   do
      netperf -H <tester ip> -j -c -l 60 -t TCP_STREAM --
         -k DIRECTION,THROUGHPUT,MEAN_LATENCY,LOCAL_CPU_UTIL,REMOTE_CPU_UTIL,LOCAL_BYTES_SENT,REMOTE_BYTES_RECVD,LOCAL_SEND_SIZE &

      netperf -H <tester ip> -j -c -l 60 -t TCP_MAERTS --
         -k DIRECTION,THROUGHPUT,MEAN_LATENCY,LOCAL_CPU_UTIL,REMOTE_CPU_UTIL,LOCAL_BYTES_SENT,REMOTE_BYTES_RECVD,LOCAL_SEND_SIZE &
   done

Running the following commands will trigger :command:`netperf` clients to measure UDP burst performance for
60 seconds at various burst/datagram sizes and report CPU utilization.

- For UDP egress tests, run :command:`netperf` client from DUT and start :command:`netserver` on tester.

.. code-block:: console

   netperf -H <tester ip> -j -c -l 60 -t UDP_STREAM -b <burst_size> -w <wait_time> -- -m <UDP datagram size>
      -k DIRECTION,THROUGHPUT,MEAN_LATENCY,LOCAL_CPU_UTIL,REMOTE_CPU_UTIL,LOCAL_BYTES_SENT,REMOTE_BYTES_RECVD,LOCAL_SEND_SIZE

- For UDP ingress tests, run :command:`netperf` client from tester and start :command:`netserver` on DUT.

.. code-block:: console

   netperf -H <DUT ip> -j -C -l 60 -t UDP_STREAM -b <burst_size> -w <wait_time> -- -m <UDP datagram size>
      -k DIRECTION,THROUGHPUT,MEAN_LATENCY,LOCAL_CPU_UTIL,REMOTE_CPU_UTIL,LOCAL_BYTES_SENT,REMOTE_BYTES_RECVD,LOCAL_SEND_SIZE

  **IMPORTANT**: The performance numbers can be severely affected if the media is
  mounted in sync mode. Hot plug scripts in the filesystem mount
  removable media in sync mode to ensure data integrity. For performance
  sensitive applications, umount the auto-mounted filesystem and
  re-mount in async mode.

Partial I/O Data
- All voltage rails were measured to be near 0V

.. note::

   The measurements shown are from an SK-AM62B-P1. Results may vary based off of the board variant being used.

Further optimizations are possible for these low power modes. Please refer to the AM62x Power Consumption App Note (https://www.ti.com/lit/pdf/spradg1)

Resume Latency Performance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. csv-table:: LPM Resume Latency Performance
   :header: "Low Power Mode","Total Resume Latency (ms)"

   "DeepSleep", "137"
   "MCU Only", "94"

The performance numbers are measured without the Linux printk logs. To remove the
Linux printk logs, run the following commands in the terminal:

.. code:: console

   # Detach kernel serial console
   consoles=$(find /sys/bus/platform/devices/*.serial/ -name console)
   for console in ${consoles}; do
        echo -n N > ${console}
   done

.. note::

   The measurements shown are from using the default SDK with no extra optimizations.

Further optimizations are possible for these low power modes. Please refer to the AM62x Power Consumption App Note (https://www.ti.com/lit/pdf/spradg1)
