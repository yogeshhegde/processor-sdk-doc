System Benchmarks
-------------------

LMBench
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
LMBench is a collection of microbenchmarks of which the memory bandwidth 
and latency related ones are typically used to estimate processor 
memory system performance. More information about lmbench at
https://lmbench.sourceforge.net/whatis_lmbench.html and
https://lmbench.sourceforge.net/man/lmbench.8.html

**Latency**: :command:`lat_mem_rd-stride128-szN`, where N is equal to or smaller than the cache
size at given level measures the cache miss penalty. N that is at least
double the size of last level cache is the latency to external memory.

**Bandwidth**: :command:`bw_mem_bcopy-N`, where N is equal to or smaller than the cache size at
a given level measures the achievable memory bandwidth from software doing
a memcpy() type operation. Typical use is for external memory bandwidth
calculation. The bandwidth is calculated as byte read and written counts
as 1 which should be roughly half of STREAM copy result.

Execute the LMBench with the following:

.. code-block:: console

    cd /opt/ltp
    ./runltp -P j721e-idk-gw -f ddt/lmbench -s LMBENCH_L_PERF_0001

Stream
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
STREAM is a microbenchmark for measuring data memory system performance without
any data reuse. It is designed to miss on caches and exercise data prefetcher
and speculative accesses.
It uses double precision floating point (64bit) but in
most modern processors the memory access will be the bottleneck.
The four individual scores are copy, scale as in multiply by constant,
add two numbers, and triad for multiply accumulate.
For bandwidth, a byte read counts as one and a byte written counts as one,
resulting in a score that is double the bandwidth LMBench will show.

.. code-block:: console

MultiBench
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
MultiBench\ |trade| is a suite of benchmarks that allows processor and system
designers to analyze, test, and improve multicore processors. It uses three
forms of concurrency: Data decomposition: multiple threads cooperating on
achieving a unified goal and demonstrating a processor's support for fine grain
parallelism.
Processing multiple data streams: uses common code running over multiple threads and
demonstrating how well a processor scales over scalable data inputs.
Multiple workload processing: shows the scalability of general-purpose processing,
demonstrating concurrency over both code and data.
MultiBench combines a wide variety of application-specific workloads with the EEMBC
Multi-Instance-Test Harness (MITH), compatible and portable with most any multicore
processors and operating systems. MITH uses a thread-based API (POSIX-compliant) to
establish a common programming model that communicates with the benchmark through an
abstraction layer and provides a flexible interface to allow a wide variety of
thread-enabled workloads to be tested.

.. note::

   The measurements shown are from an SK-AM62B-P1. Results may vary based off of the board variant being used.

Further optimizations are possible for these low power modes. Please refer to the AM62x Power Consumption App Note (https://www.ti.com/lit/pdf/spradg1)

The performance numbers are measured without the Linux printk logs. To remove the
Linux printk logs, run the following commands in the terminal:

.. code:: console

   consoles=$(find /sys/bus/platform/devices/*.serial/ -name console)
   for console in ${consoles}; do
        echo -n N > ${console}

   The measurements shown are from using the default SDK with no extra optimizations.
