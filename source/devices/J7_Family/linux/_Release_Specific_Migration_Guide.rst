.. note::

    - For U-Boot builds, k3-image-gen and core-secdev-k3 are no longer needed
      as **binman** is used instead. Please refer to :ref:`U-Boot build
      instructions<Build-U-Boot-label>` for the updated steps.

    - For Linux builds, generic ``defconfig`` is used instead of custom
      fragments. Please refer to `linux users guide
      <../../../linux/Foundational_Components_Kernel_Users_Guide.html#preparing-to-build>`__
      for build instructions.
