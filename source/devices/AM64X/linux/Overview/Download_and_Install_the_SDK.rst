+--------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Use Linux installer for complete source package, tools, prebuilt-image, filesystems,
etc for product development.

From a windows machine, you can only flash a SD card. This can be done without
installing the SDK. Use balenaEtcher to flash SD card from windows machine.

The |__SDK_FULL_NAME__| includes the ARM GCC toolchain.
The |__SDK_FULL_NAME__| was built and tested against a specific Linux
Distribution name and version, Ubuntu |__LINUX_UBUNTU_VERSION_SHORT__|.
Note that this **does not** prevent the user from installing the SDK on other Linux
distributions.

.. rubric:: How to Run the SDK Installer in Linux
   :name: how-to-run-the-sdk-installer-linux

Make sure that the execute permissions are set. Bring up a terminal
window and change directories to where the installer is located
(probably the Downloads directory) and run the following commands:

.. parsed-literal::

    chmod +x ./|__SDK_INSTALL_FILE__|
    ./|__SDK_INSTALL_FILE__|

Alternatively, you can give execute permissions and run the "|__SDK_INSTALL_FILE__|"
by double clicking on it within your Linux host PC.

.. rubric:: How to Run the SDK Installer in Windows
   :name: how-to-run-the-sdk-installer-windows

Double click on the installer to begin installation.

.. note::
   As a part of the installation, the installer will run a script to configure your
   environment and extract the Linux devkit. This will cause the installation to
   continue for roughly a minute even after it shows that it has reached 100%.

.. note::
   If nothing seems to happen, your computer may be running a 32-bit version of
   its operating system. The installer is 64-bit, and will not execute properly.
