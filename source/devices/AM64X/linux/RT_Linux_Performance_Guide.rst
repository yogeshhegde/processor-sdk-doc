System Benchmarks
-------------------------

LMBench
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
LMBench is a collection of microbenchmarks of which the memory bandwidth 
and latency related ones are typically used to estimate processor 
memory system performance. More information about lmbench at 
https://lmbench.sourceforge.net/whatis_lmbench.html and
https://lmbench.sourceforge.net/man/lmbench.8.html
  
**Latency**: :command:`lat_mem_rd-stride128-szN`, where N is equal to or smaller than the cache
size at given level measures the cache miss penalty. N that is at least
double the size of last level cache is the latency to external memory.

**Bandwidth**: :command:`bw_mem_bcopy-N`, where N is equal to or smaller than the cache size at
a given level measures the achievable memory bandwidth from software doing
a memcpy() type operation. Typical use is for external memory bandwidth
calculation. The bandwidth is calculated as byte read and written counts
as 1 which should be roughly half of STREAM copy result.

Execute the LMBench with the following:

.. code-block:: console

    cd /opt/ltp
    ./runltp -P j721e-idk-gw -f ddt/lmbench -s LMBENCH_L_PERF_0001

Dhrystone
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Dhrystone is a core only benchmark that runs from warm L1 caches in all
modern processors. It scales linearly with clock speed. For standard ARM
cores the DMIPS/MHz score will be identical with the same compiler and flags.

Linpack
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Linpack measures peak double precision (64 bit) floating point performance in
solving a dense linear system.

CoreMarkPro
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
CoreMark\ |reg|-Pro is a comprehensive, advanced processor benchmark that works
with and enhances the market-proven industry-standard EEMBC CoreMark\ |reg|
benchmark. While CoreMark stresses the CPU pipeline, CoreMark-Pro tests the
entire processor, adding comprehensive support for multicore technology, a
combination of integer and floating-point workloads, and data sets for utilizing
larger memory subsystems.

.. warning::

  **IMPORTANT**: The performance numbers can be severely affected if the media is
  mounted in sync mode. Hot plug scripts in the filesystem mount
  removable media in sync mode to ensure data integrity. For performance
  sensitive applications, umount the auto-mounted filesystem and
  re-mount in async mode.

RP Message Inter-Processor Communication (IPC) Latency
-------------------------------------------------------

RP Message latency Performance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

RP Message latency is the delay measured from sending a round trip echo message from
a Linux application to a remote processor and back. The following measurements use
a RP message length of 1 byte and 490 bytes for comparison.

The Linux user space application `rpmsg_char_benchmark <https://git.ti.com/cgit/rpmsg/ti-rpmsg-char/>`__ captures these latency values.

Test commands used for running IPC latency tests:

.. code:: console

   rpmsg_char_benchmark -r 2 -n 100000 -m 1 & chrt -f -p 80 $!

Latencies reported:
